# DtCyber
[Nostalgic Computing Center](http://www.nostalgiccomputing.org) fork of DtCyber emulator of Control Data 6000 series supercomputers.

Visit the [NOS2.8.7](NOS2.8.7) directory to find artifacts and information enabling you to install
the NOS 2.8.7 operating system on *DtCyber* after building the emulator.

Visit the [doc](doc) directory to find the somewhat outdated *Basic Operation* guide for *DtCyber*. This guide is
centered around operation of an older version of the operating system. Nevertheless, most of the basic concepts
apply to NOS 2.8.7, and most information about operating *DtCyber* itself still applies.

Visit the [CDC documentation archives at Bitsavers](http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/cdc/) for a wealth
of preserved documentation on Control Data hardware and software. In particular, the
[scans contributed by Tom Hunter](http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/cdc/Tom_Hunter_Scans/) provide
a wealth of information about the CDC 6000, 70, 170, and 700 series machines and the software that
ran on them (and continues to run on *DtCyber*).
