<h1>SCOPE/Hustler Demo</h1>
<p>This document describes how to run SCOPE/Hustler using the PC-based mainframe
emulator DtCyber.&nbsp; It specifically focuses on running a kiosk-style
demo.&nbsp; The demo is really a running copy of SCOPE/Hustler--not a mockup.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>You should have three zip archives of files from MRR containing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>servers:&nbsp; The DtCyber CDC 6000 hardware emulator and the <a href="http://frend2.sourceforge.net">frend2</a>
    front-end (FREND) emulator.&nbsp; This acts as a telnet server running on
    port 6500.</li>
  <li>media:&nbsp; Disk and tape image files that are used to emulate CDC disk
    drives and tape drives.</li>
  <li>client:&nbsp; The telexpt client program, which acts as a terminal
    emulator.&nbsp; This is an optional component.&nbsp; Also included is a copy
    of the Win32 program <a href="http://scredit2.sf.net">scredit2</a>, a
    partial SCREDIT emulator.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also need a decent PC running a 32-bit, or better yet, 64-bit
version of Windows.&nbsp; (On the same hardware, the 64-bit version of DtCyber
is about twice as fast as the 32-bit version.)&nbsp; Note: DtCyber will consume
100% of your CPU.&nbsp; Don't run it on a computer that is being used for other
purposes unless you have multiple CPUs.</p>
<p>Unzip all files into a directory.&nbsp; I suggest C:\DtCyber.&nbsp; Some of
the zip files contain directory names, so use an unzip program that respects
directory names (most do).</p>
<h2>Deadstarting SCOPE/Hustler</h2>
<p>From the main directory, run Start32.bat (if you have a 32-bit OS), or
Startx64.bat (if you have a 64-bit OS).&nbsp; This will run both DtCyber and its
pal frend2.</p>
<p>Type these commands into the main screen of DtCyber:</p>

<p>Now SCOPE/Hustler is running.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Running the clients</h2>
<p>For a SCOPE/Hustler demo to be interesting, the machine should be running
some jobs.&nbsp; I have written a simple Java-based terminal emulator, telexpt,
which runs an interactive session via a script.&nbsp; (I tried to use the
well-known program <a href="http://expect.nist.gov/">Expect</a>, but it simply
does not work under Windows with Telnet.)</p>
<p>If your computer has two monitors, you can run the client on the same
computer that is running DtCyber.&nbsp; telexpt does not require much CPU, so it
won't significantly harm DtCyber's performance.</p>
<p>If your computer does not have two monitors, you will want to run the clients
on a separate computer, so the session windows do not overlap the Cyber console
window.&nbsp; If they do overlap, no harm is done--but the demo will be less
interesting.</p>
<p>telexpt requires the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Java
Runtime</a>.&nbsp; Install it.&nbsp; Make sure that the Java runtime's bin
directory is in your path.</p>
<p>Open a command prompt and change directory to DtCyber\client.&nbsp; Run
startClients.bat.&nbsp; This will run two clients.</p>
<p>Here are some accounts that have been added to the authorization file.&nbsp;
All are Systems accounts:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Password&nbsp;</b></td>
    <td><b>PN</b></td>
    <td><b>Userid</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>redact</td>
    <td>0117370&nbsp;</td>
    <td>  katz&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>redact</td>
    <td>0117371&nbsp;</td>
    <td>  renwick&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>redact</td>
    <td>0117372&nbsp;</td>
    <td>  nelson&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>redact</td>
    <td>0117373&nbsp;</td>
    <td>  bedoll&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>Recent stress-testing has revealed some problems with interactive
usage.&nbsp; I probably won't have time to fix them before the demo.</p>
<p>It appears that some software component--probably frend2--cannot cope with
many (or even more than two?) simultaneous interactive sessions.&nbsp; So, don't
try more than two sessions.&nbsp; frend2's console allows one special
interactive session that does not involve telnet:&nbsp; press F2 in the frend2
window.&nbsp; This third session does not seem to interfere with the telnet
sessions, so it is a way of having a third session.</p>
<p>MANAGER sometimes aborts.&nbsp; To fix this without redeadstarting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Exit frend2 (hit F10 in the frend2 window).</li>
  <li>Run frend2.exe from the DtCyber directory.</li>
  <li>Run MANAGER again (1.X MANAGER,NOLOAD.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes you can simply run MANAGER again without bouncing frend2.</p>
