# product.idx
#
# This file is an index of products that can be built and added to the NOS 2.8.7
# system. Lines beginning with "#" are ignored as comments. Lines beginning with
# "*" are displayed verbatim by the "list" option. Other lines are index entries.
# Each index entry has eight fields, and the delimiter between fields is a blank.
# The fields are:
#
#   1) Product name
#   2) "Pre" scripts. Comma-separated list of expect scripts sourced before
#      queueing the product's build job on the card reader. The scripts are
#      assumed to be located in the opt subdirectory. "*" is specified if
#      a product does not have any "pre" scripts to execute.
#   3) "Post" scripts. Comma-separated list of expect scripts sourced after
#      the product's build job has completed successfully. The scripts are
#      assumed to be located in the opt subdirectory. "*" is specified if
#      a product does not have any "post" scripts to execute.
#   4) Library number. The library number in which the product will be installed
#      on the deadstart tape, if any. 0 is specified if a product is not installed
#      on the deadstart tape.
#   5) Record list. The range and/or list of record types and names comprising
#      the product in the PRODUCT file. This field is provided to a GTR command
#      to extract the product from the PRODUCT file in order to SYSEDIT it
#      into a running system, when requested. "*" is specified if the product
#      will never or can not be SYSEDIT'ed into the system.
#   6) Example scripts. Comma-separated list of expect scripts and/or card decks to
#      install files and/or run jobs providing examples related to the product.
#      This can also be used to force a SYSEDIT of the product into the running
#      system, followed by additional post-build operations. The scripts are assumed
#      to be located in the examples subdirectory. "*" is specified if a product
#      does not have any example files or jobs. Script names ending in ".job" are
#      loaded on the card reader and run as jobs. Other names are assumed to be
#      expect scripts, and they are sourced.
#   7) URL. URL of the tape image or ZIP file containing installation materials
#      for the product, if any. "*" is specified if a product does not have
#      any external tape image or ZIP file to be retrieved.
#   8) Description. All remaining words are interpreted as a brief description
#      of the product, and they are displayed by the "list" option.
