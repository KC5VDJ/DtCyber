*IDENT    ATFA005
*BEFORE   HISTORY.2 
 ATFA005  PROBLEM - THE ATF SUBSYSTEM IS UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH
          ACSLS VERSIONS BEYOND ACSLS 5.1.1.  WHEN ATF SENDS A
          *QUERY* REQUEST TO ACSLS, IT NEVER RECEIVES A RESPONSE.
          ATF IS THEREFORE UNABLE TO PROCESS REQUESTS TO MOUNT
          AND DISMOUNT TAPES.  THIS PROBLEM OCCURS IF THE NETWORK
          ADDRESS SUBFIELD WITHIN THE *XID* FIELD IN THE MESSAGE
          HEADER IS NOT TERMINATED WITH A ZERO CHARACTER.  SUCH A
          TERMINATOR WAS NOT REQUIRED IN PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF ACSLS.
  
          SOLUTION - CHANGE ROUTINE *SSIICRH* TO TERMINATE THIS FIELD 
          WITH A ZERO CHARACTER.
