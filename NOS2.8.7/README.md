# Installing NOS 2.8.7
This directory tree contains a collection of artifacts facilitating the installation
from scratch of the NOS 2.8.7 operating system on *DtCyber*.
Following these instructions should produce a working instance of the
operating system that supports batch job submission via a simulated card reader
as well as interactive login via your favorite Telnet client.
Substantial automation has been provided in order to make the installation process
as easy as possible. In fact, it's nearly trivial compared to what was possible on
real Control Data computer systems back in the 1980's and 90's.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, be aware of a few details and prerequisites:

- **Git LFS**. This directory subtree contains some large binary files in the
[tapes](tapes) subdirectory. These are virtual tape images containing operating
system executables and source code. They are managed using **Git LFS**. **Git LFS**
is not usually provided, by default, with standard distributions of Git, so you will
need to install it on your host system, if you don't have it already, and you might
need to execute *git lfs pull* or *git lfs checkout* to inflate the large binary
files properly before *DtCyber* can use them. See the [README](tapes/README.md) file
in the [tapes](tapes) subdirectory for additional details.
- **Node.js**. The scripts that automate installation of the operating system and
products are implemented in Javascript and use the Node.js runtime. You will need
to have Node.js version 16.0.0 (or later) and NPM version 8.0.0 or later. Node.js and
NPM can be downloaded from the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) website, and most
package managers support it as well.
- **Privileged TCP ports**. The instance of *DtCyber* used in this process is
configured by default to use standard TCP ports for services such as Telnet (port 23)
and FTP (ports 21 and 22). These are privileged port numbers that will require you to
run *DtCyber* using *sudo* on FreeBSD, Linux and MacOS. Note that it is possible
to change the port numbers used by *DtCyber*, if necessary (see the *cyber.ini*
file).

## Installation Steps
1. If not done already, use the appropriate *Makefile* in this directory's parent
directory to build *DtCyber* and produce the *dtcyber* executable. For Windows, a
Visual Studio solution file is available. On Windows, you will also need to execute
`npm install` manually in folders `automation`, `rje-station`, `stk`, and `webterm`.
2. Start the automated installation by executing the following command. On
Windows, you will probably need to enable the *dtcyber* application to use TCP ports
21, 22, and 23 too.

| OS           | Command             |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Linux/MacOS: | `sudo node install` |
| Windows:     | `node install`      |

The process initiated by the *node* command will take some time to complete, perhaps as
much as two hours or more, depending upon your host system's speed and load. You will
see console interaction, jobs submitted via the virtual card reader, and *DtCyber*
shutting down and restarting a number of times to install the base NOS 2.8.7 operating
system and all of the currently available optional products.

After `install.js` completes, NOS 2.8.7 and all currently available optional products
will be fully installed and ready to use, and the system will be left running.
CYBIS, the Cyber Instruction System, will also be installed, but it must be started
manually by entering the following command at the NOS 2.8.7 console (i.e., *DSD*):

>`CYBIS.`

This will initiate the five subsystems comprising of CYBIS.

That's it. You have a fully operational Control Data Cyber 865 supercomputer
running the NOS 2.8.7 operating system, complete with ALGOL, APL, BASIC, COBOL, CYBIL,
FORTRAN IV and V, LISP, PASCAL, PL/1, SNOBOL, SPSS, SYMPL, COMPASS assembly language,
and various other goodies including CYBIS, ICEM (an early CAD/CAM system), CDCS (a
relational database subsystem), and GPLOT (a graphics package). Welcome back to
supercomputing in the 1980's!

## Login
You may log into the system using your web browser. *DtCyber* is configured to
start a special web server that supports browser-based terminal emulators. For the NOS
2.8.7 system, this web server listens for connections on TCP port 8001. When you request
your web browser to open the following URL:

>`http://localhost:8001`

it will display a page showing the systems served by the web server, and this will
include the NOS 2.8.7 system itself and the CYBIS subsystem running on it. When you
click on the link associated with either of these systems, an appropriate browser-based
terminal emulator will launch, and you will be invited to login. For example, when
you click on the link for system `m01` (the NOS 2.8.7 system itself), an ANSI X.364
(DEC VT-100 family) terminal emulator will launch. When you click on the link for
`cybis`, a PLATO terminal emulator will launch.

The browser-based X.364 terminal emulator is supported by a NOS 2 terminal definition
named `WEBTRM`. For example, to use FSE (the NOS Full Screen Editor) with the
browser-based terminal emulator, execute the following NOS command before entering FSE:

>`SCREEN,WEBTRM`

Note that the X.364 terminal emulator supports the APL character set for interacting
with the APL programming language, and it can be switched into Tektronix 4010
terminal emulation mode for use with graphics applications such as GPLOT and ICEM.

You may also log into the NOS 2.8.7 system itself using your favorite Telnet client,
and you may log into CYBIS using a PLATO terminal emulator such as
[pterm](https://www.cyber1.org/pterm.asp). The system listens for Telnet connections
on the default Telnet TCP port, 23, and it listens for CYBIS connections on TCP port
8005.

NOS logins supported by the system include:

| Family | Username | Password |
|--------|----------|----------|
| CYBER  | INSTALL  | INSTALL  |
| CYBER  | GUEST    | GUEST    |

INSTALL is a privileged account, and GUEST is an unprivileged one. The family named
CYBER is the default family, so you may simply press the return key in response to
the **FAMILY:** prompt during login.
.
The following CYBIS users are available:

| User   | Group  | Password |
|--------|--------|----------|
| admin  | s      | passme   |
| author | author | passme   |
| guest  | guests | public   |

## Remote Job Entry
The system listens for RJE (remote job entry) connections on TCP port 2553. You
can use [rjecli](../rje-station) and [rjews](../rje-station) to connect to this port and
submit batch jobs via the NOS 2.8.7 *RBF* (Remote Batch Facility) subsystem. The RJE
data communication protocol supported by NOS 2.8.7 is *HASP*. The example
[nos2.json](../rje-station/examples/) and
[rjews.json](../rje-station/examples/) configuration files condition
[rjecli](../rje-station) and [rjews](../rje-station), respectively, to use *HASP* to
connect and interact with NOS 2.8.7.

*DtCyber* is configured to start a special web service that supports browser-based
RJE access to the NOS 2.8.7 system. The web service listens for connections on TCP port
8085. When you request your web browser to open the following URL:

>`http://localhost:8085`

it will display a page showing the RJE hosts served by the web service, and this will
include the NOS 2.8.7 system. It will also indicate that it can provide access to the
[NOS 1.3](../NOS1.3) system. However, both the NOS 1.3 and the NOS 2.8.7 system must
be running concurrently, below) in order for you to be able to select both successfully.

When you click on the link associated with either of these systems, a browser-based
RJE station emulator will launch, and you will be presented with its console window.
The console window displays operator messages sent by the RJE host to the RJE station.
It also enables you to enter station operator commands to send to the host, and it
provides a user interface for loading the station's virtual card reader with virtual
card decks (i.e., batch jobs) to submit for execution on the host.

You may also request the browser-based RJE station emulator for NOS 2.8.7 directly by
entering the following URL:

>`http://localhost:8085/rje.html?m=m01&t=RBF%20on%20NOS%202.8.7`

An RJE command line interface is available as well. The RJI CLI can be started using
the following commands on Linux/MacOS:

>```
cd rje-station
node rjecli examples/nos2.json
```

On Windows:

>```
cd rje-station
node rjecli examples\nos2.json
```

For more information about RJE, see the [README](rje-station) file in the `rje-station`
directory.

## Shutdown and Restart
When the installation completes, NOS 2.8.7 will be running, and the command window will
be left at the DtCyber `Operator> ` prompt. Enter the `exit` command or the `shutdown`
command to shutdown the system gracefully when you have finished playing with it, and
you are ready to shut it down.

To start *DtCyber* and NOS 2.8.7 again in the future, enter the following command:

| OS           | Command           |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Linux/MacOS: | `sudo node start` |
| Windows:     | `node start`      |

## Operator Command Extensions
When installation completes successfully, and also when DtCyber is started using 
`start.js`, the set of commands that may be entered at the `Operator> ` prompt is
extended to include the following:

- `activate_tms` : activates the NOS Tape Management System. This is recommended if
you intend to use the automated StorageTek 4400 cartridge tape subsystem. You need
to execute this command only once.
- `exit` : exits the operator interface and initiates graceful shutdown of the system.
- `install_product` (aliases `install`, `ip`) : installs one or more optional products
on the system. Use `install help` to display the general syntax of the command
including options and a list of *categories* recognized by it. Use `install list` to
display the full list of individual products available. The command can be used to
install specific products by name or whole categories of products.
- `make_ds_tape` (alias `mdt`) : creates a new deadstart tape that includes products
installed by `install_product`.
- `shutdown` : initiates graceful shutdown of the system.
- `sync_tms` : synchronizes the NOS Tape Management System catalog with the
cartridge tape definitions specified in the `volumes.json` configuration file
found in the `stk` directory. See [stk/README.md](../stk/README.md) for details.

## Continuing an Interrupted Installation
The installation process tracks its progress and can continue from its last successful
step in case of an unexpected network interruption, or due to some other form of
interruption that causes the `install.js` script to exit abnormally. To continue from an
interruption, use the `continue` option as in:

| OS           | Command                      |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| Linux/MacOS: | `sudo node install continue` |
| Windows:     | `node install continue`      |

## Installing Optional Products
The `install_product` command extension enables you to re/install optional software
products for NOS 2.8.7. It also enables you to rebuild the base operating system itself
and other products provided on the initial deadstart tape. `install_product` will download tape images automatically from public libraries on the web, as needed.

To reveal a list of products that `install_product` can install, enter the
following command at the `Operator> ` prompt:

>Operator> `install list`

The `install list` command displays product names grouped by category. You may use the
`install` command to install whole categories of products or specific, individual
products. Category names are shown in category headers, and product names are shown
along with short descriptions of them.

For example, to install all products in the category named `lang` (programming languages
and toolchains), execute the following command:

>Operator> `install lang`

To install the specific product named `algol68`, execute the following command:

>Operator> `install algol68`

You may specify more than one product name or category on the command line as well, and
`install_product` will install the multiple products and/or categories requested. By
default, `install_product` will not re-install a product that is already installed. You
can force it to re-install a product or whole category by specifying the `-f` command
line option, as in:

>Operator> `install -f algol68`

Finally, you may request all not-yet-installed products to be installed by
specifying `all` as the product name, as in:

>Operator> `install all`

New products are added to the repository from time to time, so this command is particularly useful for installing products that were not available when you first
installed NOS 2.8.7 (or since the last time you executed the command).

These lists will grow, so revisit this page to see what new products have been added,
use `git pull` to update the lists in your local repository clone, and then use
`install all` to install them.

## Creating a New Deadstart Tape  
Jobs initiated by `install_product` insert the binaries they produce into the
direct access file named `PRODUCT` in the catalog of user `INSTALL`, and they also
update the file named `DIRFILE` to specify the system libraries with which the
binaries are associated. To create a new deadstart tape that includes the contents
of `PRODUCT`, execute the following command:

>Operator> `make_ds_tape`

`make_ds_tape` reads the current deadstart tape, calls `LIBEDIT` to replace or
add the contents of `PRODUCT` as directed by `DIRFILE`, and then writes the resulting
file to a new tape image. The new tape image will be a file with path
`NOS2.8.7/tapes/newds.tap`. To restart NOS 2.8.7 with the new tape image, first shut it
down gracefully using the `shutdown` command:

>Operator> `shutdown`

Then, when shutdown is complete, save the old deadstart tape image and activate the
new one by renaming them, as in:

| OS           | Command                            |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| Linux/MacOS: | `mv tapes/ds.tap tapes/ods.tap`    |
|              | `mv tapes/newds.tap tapes/ds.tap`  |
| Windows:     | `ren tapes\ds.tap tapes\ods.tap`   |
|              | `ren tapes\newds.tap tapes\ds.tap` |

To restart the system using the new deadstart tape, use the `start.js` script, as in:

| OS           | Command           |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Linux/MacOS: | `sudo node start` |
| Windows:     | `node start`      |

## Installing a Minimal System
If you prefer to install a minimal NOS 2.8.7 system with a subset of optional
products, or none of the optional products, you may accomplish this by specifying the
`basic` option when calling the `install.js` script, as in:

| OS           | Commands                  |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Linux/MacOS: | `sudo node install basic` |
| Windows:     | `node install basic`      |

The `basic` option causes `install.js` to install a minimal NOS 2.8.7 system without any
optional products. To install optional products atop the basic system, use the
`install_product` command, as in:

>Operator> `install lang`

In case a basic installation is interrupted before completing successfully, use the
`continue` option to proceed from the point of interruption, as in:

| OS           | Commands                           |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| Linux/MacOS: | `sudo node install basic continue` |
| Windows:     | `node install basic continue`      |

## A Note About Anti-Virus Software
The installation scripts automatically download tape images and other files, as
needed, from the internet. Anti-virus software can interfere with this process
and prevent these files from being downloaded successfully. If an installation script
fails to download a file successfully and exits with an error indication, and
anti-virus software is running on your host system, look into configuring the
anti-virus software such that it does not apply to files being downloaded to the
NOS2.8.7/opt/tapes directory of your *DtCyber* git repository.
