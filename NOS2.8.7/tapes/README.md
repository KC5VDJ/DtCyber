# Tapes
The tape images in this directory are large binary files managed by Git LFS, so you must have
**git-lfs** installed on your system in order to clone and check them out properly. For example,
after cloning the *DtCyber* repository, if the *.bz2* files appear as small (e.g., 133 bytes) text files,
you will need to run **git lfs pull** or **git lfs checkout** to pull the actual binary
content from GitHub.

After obtaining the full *.bz2* files, you will need to use a tool such as **bunzip2** to
expand them into their original *.tap* forms before *DtCyber* will recognize them as proper
tape images.

Note that these tape images are made available by permission of BT Federal under provisions
of the [BT Federal Permit](https://cdc.sjzoppi.com/doku.php?id=b_t_permit). BT Federal has given
permission to hobbyists, researchers and museums to freely use and share CDC material.
The only restriction is that this material cannot be used commercially.
Previous time limits no longer apply.
