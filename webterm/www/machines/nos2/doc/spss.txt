   March 1982    A         Revised and  rewritten  by  Betty  Benson.   The
                           purpose  of  this  update  is  to  document  all 
                           differences between Version 8.3 of SPSS-6000  as 
                           currently    implemented   and   the   pair   of 
                           McGraw-Hill manuals% SPSS,  Second  Edition  (1)
                           and SPSS UPDATE 7-9 (2), which together describe 
                           SPSS Version 9.0 for IBM systems.  Some  of  the 
                           material  in  this document was adapted from the
                           UPDATE 7-9 manual. 

                           These   differences   include   procedures   and
                           features  which  are  not available in SPSS-6000 
                           Version  8.3,  additional  SPSS-6000  procedures 
                           which  are  documented  separately, and specific
                           extensions  and  incompatibilities   which   are 
                           described in this update.

   Additional Procedures and Documents 


   The following statistical procedures and  extensions  are  available  in
   SPSS-6000  but  are  not documented in the SPSS manual (1) or the UPDATE
   7-9 manual (2).  Documentation for them is not included here but  exists
   as   separate   writeups.    Contact   the  local  SPSS-Coordinator  for
   information about the availability of the following documents. 


   G3SLS (Generalized and Three Stage Least Squares) 

   Two- and three-stage least squares estimates  of  the  parameters  of  a 
   system  of  simultaneous  stochastic  equations.   Performs  constrained
   estimation of the parameters for single or  multiple  equation  systems.
   Theil's  mixed  estimator  can  be  calculated.   An F-test of a general
   linear  hypothesis  is  also  available  for  ordinary  and  constrained 
   estimation.

   Likelihood, and Unweighted Least Squares. 
   Reference - SPSS JFACTOR, SPSS Document No. 412, Revision B (4).


   NONLINEAR (Nonlinear Regression)

   Nonlinear least squares analysis; model specification is made in FORTRAN 
   language;  user  need  not define gradient function; optional weighting; 
   bounds on parameters; choice of Gauss' or Marquardt's  method;  multiple
   dependent variables; parameter fixing.
   Reference - SPSS NONLINEAR, SPSS Manual No. 433, Revision B (5).


   PLOT (Digital Plotting) 

   Produces bivariate plots on a digital plotter.  Multi-line plots can  be 
   generated.   More  than  one  dependent  variable  can be plotted with a
   single independent variable or the relationship between  an  independent 
   and  dependent  variable can be plotted for different groups through the 
   use of a control variable.  For each  group  or  dependent  variable,  a 
   regression line and confidence interval can be plotted.

   Differences Between SPSS-6000 and McGraw-Hill Manuals (1) and (2) 


   Throughout the  following  pages,  "SPSS"  will  be  used  in  reference
   citations,  to refer to the McGraw-Hill manual SPSS, Second Edition (1),
   and "UPDATE" will be used to refer to SPSS UPDATE 7-9 (2). 


   AGGREGATE

   In abbreviated batch or online format (see page  83  of  this  document) 
   SKEW,  KURT,  PCTGT,  PCTLT,  and  PCTBTN  are  not  printed  as part of 
   STATISTIC 2 or 3.

   Skewness and kurtosis are now calculated as Fisher's G statistics. 
   See CONDESCRIPTIVE on page 12 of this document for the formulas. 

   The following additional OPTIONs are available (SPSS, page 214). 

   OPTION 5.      Causes the binary output file to be  written  without  an 
                  end-of-record after each case.  When there are only a few
                  variables per case, this OPTION can save  a  considerable 
                  amount  of disk or tape space.  This form of blocked file
                  does not contain any special control words (CRM format is 
                  BT=C,RT=S);  it can be read by SPSS with the INPUT FORMAT 
                  BINARY specification.

   OPTION 6.      Causes an end-of-file to be written after the data on the 
                  binary output file. 

   OPTION 7.      Suppresses the AGGREGATE output data file.   This  OPTION
                  can  save  processing  time and disk space if the printed
                  output is all that is desired from AGGREGATE. 

   OPTION 8.      Suppresses the printed  output.   This  OPTION  can  save
                  processing  time  and  paper  if  the printed output from 
                  AGGREGATE is not needed.  (NOTE - This  OPTION  does  not
                  suppress STATISTICS which are explicitly requested). 

   OPTION 9.      Causes the AGGREGATE output to be written on a  formatted
                  (BCD)  output  file.   This OPTION can be used when it is 
                  desirable to punch the AGGREGATE output, or when the file 
                  is to be used as input to another program. 

   The  format  for  the  BCD  output  case  is  generated according to the
   following rules. 
  

         1.   The group number and number of cases in the group are written
              in F8.0 format in columns 1-8 and  9-16  of  the  first  card 


1 


   Page 5                          SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982


              image. 

         2.   If OPTION 3 is selected, the values of the grouping variables 
              are written on the first card starting in  column  17.   Each
              grouping  variable  is written in 8 or 12 columns.  Depending 
              on their PRINT FORMATs, numeric variables are  written  using
              F12.0 to F12.7; alphanumeric variables are written using A8.

         3.   If  OPTION  3  is selected, the output for the first variable
              starts on a new card; otherwise, it appears on the first card 
              starting in column 17.

         4.   The  output for each variable after the first starts on a new 
              card in column 1. 

         5.   For  each  keyword  in  the  AGGSTATS=  list,  the  following 
              specification is generated for each variable.

                  Keyword        Format
                  VALIDN         F8.0 
                  SUM            F16.4
                  MEAN           F14.4
                  SD             F14.4
                  MAX            F12.4
                  MIN            F12.4
                  SKEW           F14.4
                  KURT           F14.4
                  PCTGT          F4.0 
                  PCTLT          F4.0 
                  PCTBT          F4.0 

   The generated format  statement  is  printed  out  at  the  end  of  the
   AGGREGATE  run.   Note  that the above set of rules can generate a 'card 
   image' greater than 80 characters.  This is only a problem if  the  data 
   are   to  be  punched,  in  which  case  the  user  should  specify  two 
   VARIABLES=/AGGSTATS= lists instead of one long AGGSTATS= list.


   The  binary  output  file  created by AGGREGATE contains no special flag 
   words, control words or record counts (e.g., BT=C, RT=S).  To read  this 
   file  in  a  FORTRAN  program,  the  following sequence of control cards 
   should be used.

   To  read  a  binary  output  file  from AGGREGATE in SPSS, use the INPUT 
   FORMAT BINARY specification.


   ALLOCATE 

   The ALLOCATE control card (SPSS, pages 111-115) is ignored by SPSS-6000.
   In  general,  SPSS-6000 will compute the exact amount of memory required
   and will allocate it automatically.  Since  the  system  handles  memory 
   management, it is never necessary to compute WORKSPACE or TRANSPACE.  In 
   rare cases, the REPORT, DISCRIMINANT and MULT  RESPONSE  procedures  may 
   need  additional  field  length  which can be allocated using the SET CM 
   control card (see page 77 of this document). 


   Alphanumeric Variables

   The maximum field width of an alphanumeric variable is A8,  not  A4  (as 
   the  SPSS  manual  says, pages 28,43).  FREQUENCIES in GENERAL mode with 
   OPTION 5 (condensed format) only displays the leftmost 4  characters  of 
   an alphabetic variable.


   Bad Input Values

   The reporting of bad data values encountered while doing coded input was 
   enhanced in Version 8.3.  Such bad values  will  be  set  to  the  first
   missing value for the variable if any, otherwise to -0.


   Blanks and Zeros - When Can the Keyword BLANK Be Used? 

   Blank  data fields are normally treated as zeros by SPSS.  However, when
   it is desirable to distinguish between  blanks  and  0s,  a  -0  can  be
   specified on some SPSS control cards to refer only to blank fields.  The
   keyword BLANK (or the equivalent BLANKS) may be used in place of -0,  on 
   any SPSS data definition or data transformation control card.  The value
   -0 (or the keyword BLANK) is not allowed as the upper or lower bound  of 
   a missing value range specification.

   BLANK  should  be  used  only for numeric variables.  ' ' is the correct
   specification to indicate blanks in alphanumeric  variables.   BLANK  is 
   not recognized as -0 on a statistical procedure control card.

   BREAKDOWN

   In abbreviated batch or online format (see page 83 of this document) the
   sum  and  variance  for  each  group are not printed.  Grid lines in the 
   CROSSBREAK table are suppressed in online format.


   CANCORR

   OPTION 10 is not implemented (SPSS, page 524). 

   The following additional OPTIONs are available (page 524). 

   OPTION 18.     Means and standard deviations are to be read in with  the
                  correlation  matrix (See SPSS, Section 20.4.2 for details
                  on order and formats). 

   OPTION 19.     COMPUTE cards for computing the canonical variate  scores 
                  are written on the alternate output file (e.g., BCDOUT).

   OPTION 20.     Causes the mean to be substituted for missing  data  when
                  the correlation or covariance matrix is being computed.


   Compressed System Files

   An  SPSS  system file (created by SAVE FILE or SAVE ARCHIVE) can require 
   considerably more disk or tape storage than the corresponding BCD  file,
   since each variable is stored in one computer word (the equivalent of 10
   characters in a BCD file).  However, system files in which most  of  the 
   unused  space  is compressed out may be created; such files are known as
   compressed system files.

   Using compressed files can result in spectacular savings in  disk  space
   and  permanent  file  charges.   For example, a file that would normally 
   occupy 5925 PRUs (disk blocks) required only 771 PRUs  when  compressed. 
   However,  nothing  is  ever  free,  and in the case of compressed system
   files, central processor time is increased  when  the  files  are  read.
   Using  the above file, a run executing a single SPSS procedure increased 
   in CP time from 7.8 to  17.5  seconds.   Thus,  the  compressed  feature 
   appears to be appropriate for large files that are not heavily used. 

   When  a  compressed file is being processed, the data are 'decompressed' 
   while the file is being read for the first procedure.  As is  true  with 
   uncompressed  files,  if  there is more than one procedure in the job, a
   binary copy of the data is written on a  scratch  disk  file  in  uncom-
   pressed  mode.  This means that the penalty in CP time for decompression
   is only for the first procedure.  This also means that a job run against 
   a  compressed  file  with more than one procedure will cause an expanded 
   copy of the data to be written.

   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 8 


   To  write  a compressed system file, the keyword COMPRESSED is specified 
   on the SAVE FILE or SAVE ARCHIVE card.  The format of the SAVE FILE card 
   is%

             1              16
             SAVE FILE      COMPRESSED file name, file label 

   The format of the SAVE ARCHIVE card to create a compressed file is%

             1              16
             SAVE ARCHIVE   COMPRESSED file name, file label/
                            FILE=infile, VARIABLES=variable list/ 
                            FILE=...

   No  other changes are required to a job deck set up for writing a system 
   file.  No changes at all are required to read a compressed  system  file
   since SPSS-6000 automatically recognizes such a file. 

   The  compressed  file  feature  is not designed for efficient storage of
   variables with extremely large values,  with  alphanumeric  or  negative
   values,  or  with  values with fractional parts.  In fact, compressing a 
   file which consists of such values may actually require more space  than 
   had  the file been saved in uncompressed format.  The compressed feature 
   is best suited for large files which are  not  heavily  used  and  which
   consist primarily of integral values between -0 and 16383. 


   COMPUTE

   The  following  additional functions are implemented (SPSS, page 98; and
   pages 275-278 UPDATE).

   ACCUM     Sums  across  cases.   The argument to ACCUM (variable name or 
             expression) is evaluated and then added to the sum of all  the
             previous arguments.  The value generated for a particular case
             is the running sum, up to  that  point  in  the  file.   ACCUM
             ignores MISSING VALUE indicators.  However, missing values can
             be effectively deleted from the sum  by  recoding  them  to  0 
             before  using  the  ACCUM  function.   It  is not necessary to
             recode BLANK missing values, since the internal representation
             of a blank is -0.

             1              16
             COMPUTE        CUMINC=ACCUM(INCOME)

             generates cumulative income in CUMINC.

   ARCSIN    Although  the  SPSS  data  transformation  language  does  not
             provide the arcsin function, it  can  be  computed  using  the
             arctangent and square root functions as follows%

             1              16
             COMPUTE        VARX = 2*ATAN (VARX/(1+SQRT (1-VARX*VARX))) 

   JULIAN    The  JULIAN  function  algorithm  is  equivalent to the YRMODA 
             function (see UPDATE Section  11.9,  pages  277-278),  and  is
             provided  only  for  compatibility with versions prior to 8.3.
             The arguments to JULIAN are in  a  different  order  than  the 
             arguments to YRMODA.  The following statements are equivalent%

             1              16
             COMPUTE        DATE = JULIAN (MONTH,DAY,YEAR)
             COMPUTE        DATE = YRMODA (YEAR,MONTH,DAY)

   LAG       Replaces  the  value  of  a  variable  with  the  value of the
             previous case and may be used to lag time-ordered data.   (The 
             equivalent  capability  is  provided  in  IBM  SPSS by the LAG
             command, see UPDATE, pages 280-283.)

             Unlike other SPSS functions, the LAG function cannot  be  used 
             freely  with  other  arithmetic operations or functions in the
             COMPUTE statement.  A variable may be lagged one  time  period
             or  multiple  time  periods,  but  no  other operations can be 
             performed with the lagging operation.

             When the LAG function is  used,  the  format  of  the  COMPUTE 
             statement is% 

             1              16
             COMPUTE        result variable=LAG(source variable)

             where 'result variable' is the  name  of  a  new  or  existing 
             variable  and  'source  variable'  is  the name of an existing 
             variable which is to be lagged.  For example,  to  generate  a
             new variable D1 which is D lagged one case% 

             1              16
             COMPUTE        D1=LAG(D) 

             When the  cases  are  processed,  the  current  value  of  the
             variable is saved in a temporary location and then replaced by 
             the value of the previous case.  Thus, 'result  variable'  and
             'source variable' may be the same variable as in%

             1              16
             COMPUTE        D=LAG(D)

             Lagging several periods can be accomplished by  nesting  lags. 
             For example, a three-period lag could be coded%

             1              16
             COMPUTE        D3=LAG(LAG(LAG(D))) 



1 


   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 10


             If the term to be lagged is  not  a  simple  variable  but  an
             arithmetic    combination    of    several    variables,   the 
             transformation should be coded in several steps.  For example, 
             if  you  want to create a new variable which is the lagged sum 
             of X,Y, and Z,  the  variable  should  be  created  using  two
             COMPUTE statements.

             1              16
             COMPUTE        XYZ=X+Y+Z 
             COMPUTE        XYZ=LAG(XYZ)

             Lagging  variables  automatically creates missing values.  All 
             lagged variables are missing for the first case in  a  subfile 
             group;  any variable lagged two cases is missing for the first 
             and second cases, and so on.  Some value must be supplied  for 
             these  missing  observations.  SPSS supplies a value according
             to the following rules. 

             1.   If an ASSIGN MISSING card is in  effect  for  the  result
                  variable, the value specified on it is used. 


             2.   If a MISSING VALUES card is in effect and the result  and
                  source variables are the same, the value assigned will be
                  either the low end value of a missing value range or,  if 
                  no  range  was  specified,  the first value listed on the
                  MISSING VALUES specification.

             3.   If neither  ASSIGN  MISSING  nor  MISSING  VALUES  is  in
                  effect, the value zero is supplied. 

             The  value assigned to lagged variables in the first case in a
             subfile is determined entirely by the MISSING VALUES or ASSIGN 
             MISSING  specification  for  the  result  variable.  It is not
             affected by the specification of missing values for the source
             variable.

             Lagged  variables  can  also  have  missing values because the 
             source variable has missing values.  In this case, the  actual 
             value  of the source variable is passed to the lagged variable
             unless an ASSIGN MISSING control card is used to  specify  the
             value  to  be  assigned.   In  this case, the MISSING VALUE or
             ASSIGN MISSING in effect for the source variable  is  used  to 
             identify   the   missing   value,  while  the  ASSIGN  MISSING
             specification in effect for the lagged  variable  is  used  to
             determine the value to be assigned. 

             The  following  table shows the values of GNP, GNP1, GNP2, and
             GNP3 for the first few cases of a hypothetical  file  and  the 
             control cards used to generate them.

             If only selected cases are being processed, the  placement  of
             the statement which generates the lagged variables relative to 
             the  data-selection  statement  is  critical.   If  the   card
             sequence is% 

             1              16
             SELECT IF
             .
             .
             .
             COMPUTE        GNP1=LAG(GNP) 

             the lagged value is the value of the  previous  case  selected
             for  processing  by  the SELECT IF statement.  This is because
             SPSS does not perform transformations which appear in the  job 
             deck  after  the  data-selection  card,  if  the  case  is not
             selected for processing.  Similarly, when the LAG function  is 
             used  with  a  DO  IF,  the  lagged  value is the value of the 
             previous case which satisfied the logical condition on the  DO 
             IF card. 

             If the card sequence is reversed as in%

             1              16
             COMPUTE        GNP1=LAG(GNP) 
             .
             .
             .
             SELECT IF

             the lagged value is the value of  the  previous  case  on  the 
             input   file,  regardless  of  whether  it  was  selected  for 
             processing.

   POISSON   POISSON   (m)   generates  random  numbers  from  the  POISSON 
             distribution with mean m.  See also the SEED control card.

   CONDESCRIPTIVE 

   Skewness  and  kurtosis  are  calculated  as Fisher's G statistics.  The
   first four moments are calculated as follows%

        X1 = SUM of X 
        X2 = SUM of X**2 - (SUM**2 of X/N)
        X3 = SUM of X**3 - XBAR*(SUM of X**2+2*X2)
        X4 = SUM of X**4 - XBAR*(SUM of X**3+3*X3+3*XBAR*X2)
  
                  where XBAR = the mean of X

        Skewness = X3*N/((N-1)*(N-2)*S**3) 
        Kurtosis = (X4*N*(N+1)/(N-1)-3*X2**2)/((N-2)*(N-3))/S**4 

                  where S = standard deviation of X 


   The following additional STATISTICs are available (SPSS, page 190).

   STATISTIC 12.  Sum.

   STATISTIC 13.  Coefficient of Variation (as a percentage).
                  C.V. PCT  =  100*(S/XMEAN).   See definitions below for S
                  and XMEAN. 

   STATISTIC 14.  95 percent confidence interval for the sample mean.   The
                  values printed are%

                            where

                            XMEAN is the sample mean 
                            S is the sample standard deviation
                            N is the number of cases
                            T  is  the  .025  probability  for  degrees  of 
                            freedom N-1. 

   If  STATISTICS ALL is requested, STATISTIC 9 (range) is not generated to
   conserve paper.  Since the minimum and maximum are printed, this  should
   be no hardship.

   reference  dictionary)  is  not  available  because  no  pagination   is 
   performed.


   COUNT

   The number of variables which can be named or implied on all RECODEs and 
   COUNTs in SPSS-6000 is not limited to 400 (SPSS, page  110);  the  upper
   limit depends on the amount of memory which is available. 


   CROSSTABS

   See UPDATE, Chapter 16, pages 301-304.

   OPTION 7 cannot be used with variables which have BLANK missing values. 

   OPTIONs  6 and 8 (SPSS, page 242) are available in general mode, as well
   as integer. 

   The following additional OPTIONs are available.

   OPTION 13.     Causes the tables to be suppressed.  This OPTION can save 
                  a  significant  amount  of paper when only the statistics 
                  are desired.

   OPTION 14.     Causes the grid lines  in  the  crosstabs  tables  to  be
                  suppressed.   This  is  the default in SPSS/ONLINE, where 
                  selection of this OPTION causes  the  grid  lines  to  be
                  printed. 

   Of  the  IBM  SPSS limitations for integer crosstabs (UPDATE, page 304), 
   only the last one applies, as follows% 

             No more than 20 rows or columns of missing values 
             may be printed under OPTION 7.

   In online format (see page 83 of this document) OPTION 9 (print index of 
   tables) is not available.  By default,  grid  lines  are  suppressed  in 
   online format, and OPTION 14 causes them to be printed.


   Data Checking with REPORT.  and STOP. 

   Very  often it is desirable to be able to detect certain data conditions 
   when running SPSS.  For example, you may know from  your  CONDESCRIPTIVE 
   output  that  a  particular  variable  has illegal values in one or more 
   cases.  Another common situation is  a  file  that  contains  multi-card 
   cases,  and  you  would  like  to  be sure that each case has the proper 
   number of cards and that they are in the proper order.

   The special variables REPORT. and STOP. provide a handy way of detecting

   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 14


   these kinds of data exception conditions, reporting the offending cases,
   and optionally terminating execution when serious errors are found.

   The special variables  REPORT. and  STOP. may  be  used  as  the  result
   variables for COMPUTE and IF statements (also *COMPUTE and *IF). 

   Each  time a case is read by SPSS, all user defined data transformations
   are performed in the order in which they are specified.  Transformations
   involving REPORT. and STOP. are handled no differently, except that they
   may only be used as result variables.   After  all  transformations  are
   performed  on  the case, the system checks the value of REPORT. .  If it 
   is non-zero, the subfile name, sequence number,  and  value  of  REPORT.
   are printed, and processing continues.  Similarly, STOP. is checked, and 
   if non-zero, the  information  is  printed;  however,  the  system  will 
   terminate execution with a CP abort. 

   For  example,  suppose  a user wants to know which cases have an illegal
   value (greater than 9) on VAR025%

             1              16
             *IF            (VAR025 GT 9) REPORT.=VAR025
             CONDESCRIPTIVE VAR001 TO VAR010

   In the above example, VAR025 is checked for values greater than 9  while 
   the data are being read for the CONDESCRIPTIVE procedure.  Note that the 
   procedure does not have to be CONDESCRIPTIVE.  REPORT. and STOP. can  be 
   used  with any procedure.  Note also that the procedure does not have to 
   be processing the variables being checked.  (The user is not  performing
   a CONDESCRIPTIVE on VAR025.)

   Suppose  a  card  input file has two cards per case, with an ID field in
   columns 1 to 6 and a card number in column 7.  The file is  supposed  to
   be  in  ascending  sequence  on ID number.  The user wishes to check the
   deck for proper order and to terminate the  execution  if  not  in  good
   order, since results based on a scrambled deck are useless.

                       .
             SAVE FILE
             FINISH 

   In the above example, the IDs from both cards are compared for equality,
   and the LAG facility is used to determine if the file  is  in  ascending
   sequence.

   Note  that,  if  there  are multiple problems with a case, only the last
   checked condition will be reported.  The above checks  could  have  been 
   coded in the following way.
  
             1              16
             *IF            (ID1 NE ID2) TEMP=1 
             *IF            (CARD1 NE 1) TEMP=TEMP+10 
             *IF            (CARD2 NE 2) TEMP=TEMP+100
             *COMPUTE       LAGID1=LAG(ID1) 
             *IF            (ID1 LT LAGID1) TEMP=TEMP+1000
             *COMPUTE       STOP.=TEMP



   This  sequence  of checks will generate unique numbers for each possible
   combination of errors.  For example, if ID1 is not equal to ID2, and the 
   file is out of sequence at the same case, STOP. will be set to 1001.  In 
   the case where two cards were accidentally interchanged, STOP. would  be
   set to 110, etc.

   DATA LIST

   The  keyword FIXED is not required on the DATA LIST card.  When there is
   only 1 card per case, the number of records  per  case  and  the  record 
   numbers can be omitted (SPSS, page 50).  For example,

             1              16
             DATA LIST      AGE 2-3 SEX 6 V1 TO V18 7-24

             is equivalent to 

             1              16
             DATA LIST      FIXED 1/(1) AGE 2-3 SEX 6 V1 TO V18 
                            7-24

   See  information about maximum record lengths under INPUT FORMAT on page
   40 of this document. 

   The DATA LIST BINARY feature  is  not  supported  (SPSS,  page  55,  and 
   UPDATE, pages 287-288). 


   DELETE SUBFILES

   The inclusive TO convention may be used with the DELETE SUBFILES control 
   card (SPSS, page 159). 


   DISCRIMINANT 

   See Chapter 15 of UPDATE, pages 292-300.

   Where raw data  and  matrix  input  are  used  together  (UPDATE,  pages
   297-298),  they may be on separate files, or one or both may be included 
   in the input file.  If both are on the input  file,  the  matrix  should
   precede  the  raw data.  If the matrix or raw input data reside on other 
   files, the lfn of the raw data file is specified with the  D=  parameter 
   and the lfn of the matrix file is given with the M= parameter.

   The  DISCRIMINANT  subprogram does not allocate memory dynamically.  For 
   large problems, it  may  be  necessary  to  use  the  SET CM  card.   (A
   preliminary  EDIT  run  can  be used to find out how much memory will be
   needed.) 

   In online format (see page 83 of this document) the step-by-step  output
   is by default suppressed, and OPTION 3 causes it to be printed.  OPTIONs 
   7 (print a single plot of cases), 8 (print  a  separate  plot  for  each 
   group),  and  10  (print territorial map) are not available in online or 
   abbreviated batch format.

   DO IF - Conditional Transformations

   A DO IF facility which permits conditional execution of a series of data
   transformations has been implemented in SPSS-6000.  Any number  of  data
   transformation  cards  may  be  enclosed within DO IF and END IF control 
   cards, and these transformations will be performed only if the condition
   specified on the DO IF card is true. 

   Two  other  control cards, ELSE and ELSE IF, may be used with DO IF, and 
   together they form a  powerful  extension  to  the  SPSS  transformation
   capabilities.   The DO IF, ELSE, ELSE IF, and END IF cards are described 
   and illustrated  here  using  permanent  (non-starred)  transformations.
   However,  the  same  capability  is  provided  for  temporary  (starred) 
   transformations with the *DO IF, *ELSE, *ELSE IF,  and  *END IF  control 
   cards.   For  the  sake  of clarity, the description of ELSE and ELSE IF 
   will be postponed for several pages. 

   In the simplest form, the DO IF and END IF cards are used as follows% 

             1              16
             DO IF          (Logical Expression) 
             .
             .
             .      Transformation control cards 
             .
             END IF 

   where the transformation control cards allowed between a DO IF  and  its
   corresponding END IF are%

             COMPUTE
             COUNT
             IF 
             RECODE 
             REJECT IF
             SELECT IF
             DO REPEAT and END REPEAT

   The  only  transformation  card  which  is not allowed within a DO IF is 
   SAMPLE.  DO IF may be nested within a DO REPEAT, but nesting of  DO IF's
   is not allowed.

   The  logical  expression  on  the  DO IF control card is a standard SPSS 
   logical expression.  The  transformations  within  the  DO IF  are  only 
   performed  on  those cases for which the specified logical expression is 
   true.   If  the  expression  is  false  for  a  particular   case,   the 
   transformations are skipped, and the values of all variables transformed 
   within the DO IF  remain  unchanged.   Like  SELECT IF  and  REJECT  IF, 
   missing values are not distinguished from other values in evaluating the 
   logical expression on the DO IF card.

   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 18


   An  example will illustrate how DO IF can be used.  Suppose that you are 
   studying race relations and want to  know  if  black  and  white  people
   differ  in  the prejudice that they show to persons of a different race.
   You have conducted a survey in which you asked black and  white  respon- 
   dents   similar,   but  not  identical,  questions  about  their  racial 
   attitudes.  Black respondents were asked about prejudice toward  whites,
   and  white  respondents  were  asked  about  blacks.   There  were  five
   questions measuring prejudice toward blacks and five measuring prejudice 
   toward  whites.   The  "corresponding" questions were coded as different 
   variables  called  BLKPREJ1  to  BLKPREJ5  and  WHTPREJ1  to   WHTPREJ5, 
   respectively.   An  index  of prejudice (PREJDC) can be constructed with
   DO IF as follows% 

             1              16
             DO IF          (RACE EQ 'WHITE') 
             COMPUTE        PREJDC=BLKPREJ1+BLKPREJ2 +
                            BLKPREJ3+BLKPREJ4+BLKPREJ5
             END IF 
             DO IF          (RACE EQ 'BLACK') 
             COMPUTE        PREJDC=WHTPREJ1+WHTPREJ2+ 
                            WHTPREJ3+WHTPREJ4+WHTPREJ5
             END IF 

   PREJDC is computed by the COMPUTE  within  the  first  DO IF  for  white
   respondents and by the COMPUTE within the second DO IF for black respon- 
   dents.

   Using the DO IF facility  instead  of  multiple  IF's  often  simplifies 
   control  card  preparation  and generally reduces the amount of computer 
   time needed to transform the data.   Unfortunately,  the  above  example
   (which  was  chosen  for  conceptual  clarity) does not illustrate these 
   advantages well.  SPSS will use the same amount of CP  time  to  compute
   PREJDC  in  this example as it would if the index had been computed with
   two separate IF statements.   However,  if  more  than  one  conditional
   transformation  is  involved, it will almost always be more efficient to
   use DO IF.

   For example, suppose that you want  to  classify  respondents  as  high, 
   medium,  or  low  on prejudice depending on their score on the prejudice
   index.  Further, suppose that  the  distribution  of  scores  for  black
   respondents  is  different  from  the  distribution  of  scores of white 
   respondents and that you want to use different cutting  points  for  the 
   two  groups  of  respondents.   The  use  of DO IF would be preferred to
   multiple IFs as shown below.

             1              16
             DO IF          (RACE EQ 'WHITE') 
             COMPUTE        PREJDC=BLKPREJ1+BLKPREJ2+BLKPREJ3+
                            BLKPREJ4+BLKPREJ5 
             RECODE         PREJDC(0,1,2=1)(3,4=2)(5=3) 
             END IF 
             DO IF          (RACE EQ 'BLACK') 
             COMPUTE        PREJDC=WHTPREJ1+WHTPREJ2+ 
                            WHTPREJ3+WHTPREJ4+WHTPREJ5
             RECODE         PREJDC(0,1=1)(2,3,4=2)(5=3) 
             END IF 

   If the same index were computed without the help of DO IF, the following
   control cards would be required%

             1              16
             IF             (RACE EQ 'WHITE') PREJDC=BLKPREJ1+
                            BLKPREJ2+BLKPREJ3+BLKPREJ4+BLKPREJ5 
             IF             (RACE EQ 'BLACK') PREJDC=WHTPREJ1+
                            WHTPREJ2+WHTPREJ3+WHTPREJ4+WHTPREJ5 
             IF             (RACE EQ 'WHITE' AND PREJDC EQ 2) PREJDC=1
             RECODE         PREJDC(0,1=1)(3,4=2)(5=3) 

   The general form of the DO IF facility includes an ELSE capability which
   allows a series of transformations to be performed on  those  cases  for 
   which  the  logical expression on the DO IF card is false.  When ELSE is 
   used, the FORMAT of DO IF is% 

             1              16
             DO IF          (Logical expression)
             .
             .
             .     Transformation control cards
             .
             ELSE 
             .
             .
             .     Transformation control cards
             .
             .
             END IF 

   Since every observation will be transformed in some  way  by  the  cards 
   within   this   DO IF,   the  use  of  ELSE  is  only  appropriate  when
   distinguishing between cases on the basis of  two  conditions  and  when 
   none  of the variables used in the logical expression have missing data.
   Assuming that there are only two racial groups with no missing  data  on
   RACE, this format could be used to code the prejudice index.

             1              16
             DO IF          (RACE EQ 'WHITE') 
             COMPUTE        PREJDC=BLKPREJ1+BLKPREJ2+

             RECODE         PREJDC(0,1=1)(2,3,4=2)(5=3) 
             END IF 

   An  ELSE IF  capability is also provided.  This is useful when there are 
   more than two alternative conditions to be handled, or when any  of  the
   variables  in  the DO IF expression have missing data.  The ELSE IF card
   operates similarly to the ELSE  card  except  that  the  transformations 
   between  one ELSE IF card and the next ELSE IF card (or the END IF card)
   are carried out only if the condition specified on the ELSE IF  card  is
   true.  When ELSE IF is used, the format of DO IF is% 

             1              16
             DO IF          (Logical expression)
             .
             .
             .     Transformation control cards
             .
             .
             ELSE IF        (Logical expression)
             .
             .
             .     Transformation control cards
             .
             .
             ELSE IF        (Logical expression)
             .
             .
             .     Transformation control cards
             .
             .
             END IF 

   In addition to using ELSE IF rather than  ELSE  when  there  is  missing 
   data,  an  ASSIGN  MISSING  card  should  also  be  prepared for any new
   variables created within the DO IF.  This will ensure that  cases  which 
   are  not  defined by any transformations within the DO IF are treated as 
   missing in the statistical analysis.  Assuming that  a  few  cases  were
   left  blank  on  RACE  and  should  be  excluded  from the analyses, the 
   prejudice index might be constructed as follows.

             .
             MISSING VALUES RACE(' ') 
             ASSIGN MISSING PREJDC(999) 

   Before executing any of the transformations, SPSS will  initialize  each
   case to 999 (the first missing value on PREJDC).  Any case left blank on
   RACE will not be changed by the transformations within  the  DO IF  and, 
   consequently,  will have a value of 999 on PREJDC.  Since 999 is defined
   as missing, such cases will be treated as  missing  in  any  statistical 
   analysis involving PREJDC.

   If  the  ELSE capability had been used in this situation, the results of 
   the transformations would not have been the same.  Any case  left  blank 
   on  RACE  would have been incorrectly transformed by the cards following 
   the ELSE, and it would be impossible  for  a  statistical  procedure  to
   distinguish such cases as missing.

   The completely general format of DO IF is%

             1              16
             DO IF          (Logical expression)

   Any number of ELSE IF statements are allowed between  a  DO IF  and  its 
   corresponding  END IF.   For  obvious  reasons, only one ELSE is allowed
   within a DO IF.  If ELSE  and  ELSE IF  are  both  used,  ELSE  and  its 
   associated transformations must appear in the DO IF after all ELSE IFs.

   expression, the case is not selected.   If  a  domain  error  occurs  in
   evaluating  a DO IF expression, the transformations within the DO IF are
   not performed. 


   DO REPEAT

   Constants appearing in substitution lists (see  UPDATE,  pages  279-280) 
   may  be  either  numeric  or  alphabetic;  alphabetic  constants must be
   enclosed in single quotes (').  Single values and  sets  of  consecutive
   values  generated  by  the  TO  convention may be freely intermixed in a 
   substitution list. 

   A DO REPEAT group may contain a DO IF  group,  and  a  DO IF  group  may
   contain a DO REPEAT group.

   The  IBM  SPSS  limitations  (UPDATE,  Section  11.17)  do  not apply to
   SPSS-6000, which has the following limitations% 

       1.   A maximum of 50 stand-in variables may be used in any
            DO REPEAT ...  END REPEAT group. 

       2.   A maximum of 50 statements may be entered between a
            DO REPEAT ...  END REPEAT pair. 

       3.   The maximum number of elements that can appear in the DO REPEAT
            statement  or in any single transformation statement within the 
            DO is 200.

       4.   The total number of elements in the DO REPEAT statement and all
            transformations  within that DO REPEAT group cannot exceed 800. 
            Each of the following counts as  an  element  -  variable  name 
            (named  or implied), keyword, value (named or implied), left or 
            right  parenthesis,  equal   sign,   logical,   relational   or 
            arithmetic operator.

   ERASE DOC

   The  ERASE  DOC card enables the user to completely eliminate all of the
   existing documentary information  from  an  existing  SPSS  system  file 
   (information  originally  put  on the file in one or more runs using the 
   DOCUMENT card).

   A run that updates the documentary information on an  SPSS  system  file
   would look like this%

   FACTOR 

   The following additional OPTIONs are available.

   OPTION 12.     Means and standard deviations are to be read in with  the
                  correlation  matrix  (See  Section  20.4.2  of  SPSS  for 
                  details on order and format).

   OPTION 13.     Causes the factor scores (which are computed in  response 
                  to  a FACSCORE specification) to be listed in the printed 
                  output. 


   An  additional  data-checking  feature  is  that  if  any  of  the input
   variables have near-zero (less than 1.0E-8) variances, the analysis will
   be stopped. 

   In  abbreviated  batch  or  online format (see page 83 of this document) 
   STATISTIC 8 (plot of the rotated factors) is not available.

   FINISH 

   It is no longer necessary to supply a FINISH command in an SPSS run.  If 
   the command is not entered by the user, the program will insert it. 


   Freefield Input

   Freefield input now accepts data values entered in E-format notation.

   When  SPSS statements and data reside on the same file, and NUMBERED YES 
   is specified, then  columns  73-80  are  ignored  with  Freefield.   See 
   UPDATE, page 286, Section 12.5.


   FREQUENCIES

   Skewness  and kurtosis are now calculated as Fisher's G statistics.  See 
   CONDESCRIPTIVE on page 12 of this document for the formulas. 

   The following additional STATISTICs are available (SPSS, page 201).

   STATISTIC 12.  Sum.

   STATISTIC 13.  Coefficient of Variation (as a percentage )
                  C.V. PCT  =  100*(S/XMEAN).   See definitions below for S
                  and XMEAN. 

   STATISTIC 14.  95 percent confidence interval for the sample mean.   The
                  values printed are% 

                  .95 C.I.= XMEAN-T*(S/SQRT(N)) to
                            XMEAN+T*(S/SQRT(N)) 

                            where

                            XMEAN is the sample mean 
                            S is the sample standard deviation
                            N is the number of cases
                            T  is  the  .025  probability  for  degrees  of 
                            freedom N-1. 


   The following additional OPTIONs are available (SPSS, page 201) in  both 
   general and integer mode. 

   OPTION 10.     Causes the frequencies to be printed in descending  order
                  of  value.   The frequency count for the highest value is
                  printed first, and the count  for  the  lowest  value  is 
                  printed last.  The default is to print the frequencies in


1 


   Page 25                         SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982


                  ascending order of value.

   OPTION 11.     Causes the frequencies to be printed by descending  order
                  of   frequency.    The   frequency  count  for  the  most
                  frequently occurring value  is  printed  first,  and  the 
                  count for the least frequently occurring value is printed
                  last. 

   OPTION 12.     Causes the frequencies to be printed by  ascending  order 
                  of   frequency.    The  frequency  count  for  the  least 
                  frequently occurring value  is  printed  first,  and  the 
                  count  for the most frequently occurring value is printed 
                  last. 


   In online format (see page 83 of this document) OPTION 9 (print index of 
   tables) is ignored unless OPTION 4 (write  tables  on  BCDOUT)  is  also 
   requested.


   GET ARCHIVE (also MERGE FILES) 

   The  default  local  file  names for the input files are GTARC1, GTARC2, 
   GTARC3, GTARC4, and GTARC5 (the first file named on the GET ARCHIVE card
   is assumed to be GTARC1, the second is GTARC2, etc.). 

   Any  system file used as an input file with GET ARCHIVE must be a single 
   separate file, or the first file of a multi-file set.  It  is  therefore
   recommended  that  system files to be accessed via GET ARCHIVE be stored
   as separate files on tape or disk.   However,  if  it  is  necessary  to 
   process  a  member  of  a multi-file set other than the first, it can be
   made into a separate file suitable for GET ARCHIVE processing by copying
   it  to  disk  (or tape) before calling SPSS.  The copy (which is used as 
   the GET ARCHIVE input file) must be rewound before calling SPSS. 

   When merging several SPSS files, it frequently  happens  that  variables 
   with  the  same  name  occur  in  two  (or more) files.  The actual data 
   associated  with  the  duplicate-named  variables  may  or  may  not  be
   identical.   If  the  data  are  different, the researcher might need to
   process both of the duplicate-named variables.  The  additional  OPTIONs 
   described   below   provide   for   reading  duplicate-named  variables. 
   Automatic rejection of same-named variables without aborting the run  is 
   also available. 

   Only one of the following OPTIONs can be selected on a given run. 

   OPTION 1.      If  two  or  more  variables  with  the  same  name   are
                  specified,  only  the first one is accepted for input and
                  processing -- the  others  are  simply  bypassed.   (This
                  corresponds  to  the  GET ARCHIVE processing described in
                  SPSS, page 169.)  Each such instance is reported, and the
                  total number of variables rejected is also reported.


1 


   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 26


   OPTION 2.      Same as OPTION 1, except that only the  total  number  of
                  variables rejected is reported.

   OPTION 3.      All variables designated for input are read in; that  is, 
                  same-named  variables  are  (temporarily) accepted.  Each
                  such instance  is  reported,  and  the  total  number  of
                  duplicate-named variables accepted is also reported. 

   OPTION 4.      Same as OPTION 3, except that only the  total  number  of
                  duplicate-named variables is reported. 

   While  OPTIONS  3  and  4 permit same-named variables to be read in, all 
   duplication of names must be resolved before statistical processing  can 
   take  place.   The  RENAME VARS facility should be used to assign unique
   names to the variables involved (page 65 of this document). 

   If no OPTIONs are selected (the default condition) an attempt to read in
   and process two variables with the same name constitutes a fatal error. 

   The  maximum  number  of active variables from all archive files is 1000
   (SPSS, page 168).  The maximum number of active and latent variables  is
   5000.


   GET FILE 

   The  file  name  specification  can  be omitted on the GET FILE card, in 
   which case SPSS will print the internal file  name  without  terminating
   the run for file name mismatch.

   GET SCSS/SAVE SCSS  (Batch/Conversational Interface)


                 Copyright 1981 by Northwestern University
                Based on the SPSS UPDATE, Copyright 1979 by
                      C. Hadlai Hull and Norman H. Nie


   Full  communication  between  the  SPSS  Batch  System  and   the   SCSS
   Conversational  System  is  established  with GET SCSS and SAVE SCSS, by 
   allowing the SPSS Batch System to both write and read SCSS  masterfiles.
   These  functions  are known as "transposition" since an SPSS system file
   is case-oriented, whereas an SCSS masterfile is variable-oriented.

   The SCSS Conversational System is best described in references (11)  and 
   (12).   The  following  material  assumes familiarity with both the SPSS 
   Batch System and the SCSS Conversational System.

   SAVE SCSS
   ---- ----

   The function of the SAVE SCSS control card is to save the  current  SPSS 
   Batch  System  file  as  an  SCSS  Conversational  System masterfile for 
   subsequent analysis with that system.  From a mechanical point of  view,
   SAVE  SCSS  transposes  the  data  on a case-ordered SPSS system file to
   arrive at a variable-ordered masterfile to be accessed by SCSS.

   The SAVE SCSS card is used very much like the SAVE FILE card except that
   it  is  not  possible  to  use the REORDER VARS control card on a run in 
   which a transposed file is saved.  It is possible to use the  KEEP  VARS 
   or  DELETE  VARS and SUBFILE LIST or DELETE SUBFILES cards.  The typical
   order of control cards at the end of a run in which a masterfile  is  to
   be saved is as follows%

             1              16
             DELETE VARS    ALPHA BETA GAMMA
             SAVE SCSS      FILE = MASTER 
             FINISH 

   Only active variables will be saved in the SCSS masterfile.   SAVE  SCSS 
   may be used in the same run with a SAVE FILE or SAVE ARCHIVE card.  SAVE 
   SCSS need not be associated with a GET FILE card.   An  SCSS  masterfile
   may be created with SPSS using raw data, provided all the necessary SPSS
   data definition cards are supplied.  The SAVE  SCSS  statement  has  the
   following format% 

             1              16
             SAVE SCSS      FILE=lfn 

   The FILE= subfield specifies the name of the local file  that  the  SCSS


1 


   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 28


   masterfile  is  written  to.   This  local  file  name must be of 1 to 7
   characters in length, begin  with  an  alphabetic  letter,  and  may  be
   composed  only  of the letters A thru Z and numerals 0 thru 9.  The SCSS
   masterfile should be made permanent at the end of the SPSS run  so  that
   it can be accessed as a disk-resident file from SCSS at a later time.


   Limitations on Saving an SCSS Masterfile 

   While most of the information contained in an SPSS Batch System file can
   be  converted  to  similar  information in an SCSS Conversational System
   masterfile, there are some limitations% 

       -     Blanks  (-0's)  are  treated  as  zeros   because   the   SCSS
             Conversational  System does not distinguish between blanks and 
             zeros.  You should avoid allowing blanks to designate  missing 
             information  when  zero  might  be a meaningful code.  Use the 
             SPSS Batch System's RECODE to change blanks  to  a  meaningful
             code  without  altering zero values.  SIR users be warned% SIR 
             specifies -0 as the missing value for each variable having  no
             missing  value  declared when it writes an SPSS save file.  If
             those variables have valid values of 0 in the SIR  data  base, 
             they  will  have  missing  values  of 0 in the SCSS masterfile 
             because the missing value -0 is converted to 0. 

       -     Since names in the SCSS Conversational System may contain only 
             alphabetics  and  numerics,  the name of the SPSS file may not 
             constitute a valid masterfile  name  (the  SPSS  Batch  System 
             permits  certain  special  characters  in names).  If the SPSS 
             file name does not constitute a  valid  masterfile  name,  the 
             name  is  changed  to  NONAME.  Because the current version of 
             SCSS identifies files by their local or permanent  file  names
             rather  than  by  their  internal names (as is the case in the 
             SPSS Batch System), this name is  of  no  consequence  to  the
             user.

       -     If the name of any variable does not constitute a  valid  SCSS 
             system  variable  name, that variable is dropped from the SCSS 
             masterfile.  Names are considered invalid either because  they
             contain  special  characters  or  because they are the same as
             SCSS reserved words.  The only four known SCSS reserved  words
             which  are  not  reserved  words  in the SPSS Batch System are
             AGAINST, ON, SPSS, and SPSS0001.

       -     Since the handling of alphabetic values in  SCSS  is  somewhat
             different from that in SPSS, any variable which has any values
             which are alphabetic or greater in  absolute  value  than  ten
             trillion are dropped.

       -     In the SCSS Conversational System, value labels may apply only
             to   integer  values.   Thus  any  value  labels  applying  to 
             non-integer values are dropped when SAVE SCSS is executed.

   Page 29                         SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982


   There are a few peculiarities to the SAVE SCSS function which may not be 
   obvious%

       -     The automatic variable CASWGT becomes the  weighting  variable 
             for  the  SCSS  Conversational System masterfile if it has any 
             values other than 1.0.  CASWGT is saved as a variable  on  the 
             file even if it is a constant 1.0.

       -     Since the SPSS concept of subfiles does not exist in SCSS,  an 
             existing subfile structure is handled by changing SUBFILE to a 
             discrete variable whose values range from 1 to the  number  of
             subfiles and whose value labels are the SPSS subfile names. 

       -     The automatic variable SEQNUM is retained but has actual  data
             associated  with  it  as opposed to being generated every time 
             the data are read as in SPSS.

       -     As implied earlier,  the  SPSS  file  name  becomes  the  SCSS 
             masterfile  name.   As with SPSS internal file names, the SCSS
             internal file name does not have to be related to  the  actual
             external  file  name,  although  it  is  helpful if there is a
             relationship.

       -     Two new variables are added to  the  file.   They  are  of  no
             consequence  to  the  user.  However, they do have names which 
             may not be used for other variables% SPSS and SPSS0001.  Also,
             it  is  not advisable to attempt to analyze these variables in 
             an SCSS session.


   Output from SAVE SCSS 

   Several  pieces  of  information are provided as the result of executing 
   SAVE SCSS% 

       -     Any  occurrences  of  invalid  names  are  reported  with   an 
             explanation  of  what  action  was  taken such as dropping the 
             related entity or changing the name. 

       -     A message is printed detailing the number of variables  to  be
             retained on the masterfile, the maximum number of value labels 
             which can be kept for each variable, the amount of CM required 
             for transposition, and the size of the scratch file needed for
             transposition, in PRU's. 

       -     A report is printed for all the  variables  with  valid  names
             which  are to be kept.  For each variable, the following items
             are  listed%  name,  label,  type,  cases/word,  valid  cases,
             minimum,  and  maximum.  The type may be discrete, continuous, 
             or **DROPPED**.  Discrete indicates that the variable has  all
             integer values, continuous indicates at least some non-integer
             values, and **DROPPED** indicates at least some alphabetic  or

             extreme  values  which  caused the variable to be dropped from 
             the masterfile.  Cases/word indicates the packing  density  of
             the  variable's data on the masterfile.  The density may be 1,
             2, or 4 cases per word depending on the nature of the  values.
             Non-negative  integer  values of less than 255 (which includes 
             most survey values) are packed 4 values per word, or  4  cases
             per  word.   The  valid  cases  column  gives  the  number  of
             unweighted non-missing cases for the  variable.   The  minimum 
             and  maximum  columns  give the minimum and maximum values for 
             the variable with missing values included. 

       -     A listing of the variables retained on  the  masterfile  in  a
             format similar to that used a for LIST FILEINFO SORTVARS. 

       -     A statement of the number of variables which were dropped  due 
             to invalid values.


   File and Memory Management for SAVE SCSS

   Transposition of an SPSS Batch System case-oriented file  into  an  SCSS
   Conversational System variable-oriented masterfile is performed with the 
   data on a random  access  scratch  file.   This  scratch  file  must  be 
   disk-resident.    SAVE   SCSS  uses  as  much  memory  as  possible  for
   transposition to  minimize  processing  time  and  scratch  file  space, 
   subject  to  the  constraint  that  it does not exceed the maximum field 
   length allowable.  The field length and scratch file size  required  for
   transposition  are  always  printed by SAVE SCSS.  An EDIT run should be
   used to determine how much memory and disk  space  are  required  for  a
   transposition  without  suffering the possibly expensive consequences of
   running out of mass storage.

   The size of  the  scratch  file  used  for  transposition  is  inversely
   proportional  to  the  field  length  available  to SAVE SCSS.  The more
   central memory available, the smaller the scratch file will  be,  up  to 
   the point where all the data will fit into memory.  Specifying MF=320000
   in an EDIT run will indicate the optimal field length and  scratch  file 
   size  needed for transposition.  You can calculate an upper limit on the
   amount of disk space  needed  by  SPSS  by  doubling  the  transposition
   scratch  file  size and adding in an estimate of the ZZSPS2 scratch file 
   size.  (You should expect your SCSS masterfile to be less than or  equal
   in  size to the transposition scratch file when you have relatively many 
   cases and few variables, and many of the variables are discrete.)

   GET SCSS 
   --- ---- 

   The GET SCSS control card permits  the  researcher  to  access  an  SCSS
   masterfile  for  processing  with SPSS.  As such, the card's function is 
   similar to that of the GET FILE card, and the card must be placed at the
   beginning  of  the  control card deck preceded only by run cards such as
   NUMBERED, RUN NAME, and EDIT.  As with the GET FILE card, the  GET  SCSS 
   card  may  be  followed  by  control cards requesting the reading of new 
   variables or cases, for example  ADD  VARIABLES  or  ADD  SUBFILES,  and
   control  cards  creating  new variables via the transformation facility, 
   e.g., COMPUTE, IF, COUNT.

   The control field of the GET SCSS card contains the  facility  name  GET 
   SCSS,  and  the specification field contains the required subfield FILE=
   and the optional subfields VARIABLES= and MIS=.

             1             16 
             GET SCSS      FILE= lfn / 
                           [VARIABLES=varlist         /] [MIS=RECODE/] 
                                      $varlist                LEAVE
                                      spssvar=scssvar         STOP
                                      ALL 
                                      $ALL

   The FILE= Specification

   The control field of the GET SCSS card contains the  facility  name  GET 
   SCSS, and the specification field must contain the subfield FILE=. 

             1             16 
             GET SCSS      FILE= lfn 
  
   The FILE= subfield specifies the name of the local file  that  the  SCSS
   masterfile  is  read  from.   This  local  file  name  must be of 1 to 7 
   characters in length, begin  with  an  alphabetic  letter,  and  may  be
   composed  only  of the letters A thru Z and numerals 0 thru 9.  The SCSS
   masterfile must be disk-resident so that  random  access  reads  may  be 
   performed on it.

   The VARIABLES= Specification 

   The VARIABLES= specification is used to select or rename variables which
   are to be kept  for  processing.   The  list  following  VARIABLES=  may 
   contain one or more of the following elements% 

        VARIABLES=ALL 

   The  keyword ALL is the VARIABLES= default; specifying VARIABLES=ALL has 
   the same effect as omitting VARIABLES= from  the  GET  SCSS  card.   All 
   variables  on  the  SCSS  masterfile will be included in the SPSS system
   file in their recoded form.


1 


   Page 33                         SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982


        VARIABLES=varlist

   The  simple  variable  list  names  the variables on the SCSS masterfile 
   which are to be included in the SPSS system file.  If  desired,  the  TO 
   convention  may  be  used, and the implied order is that which exists on 
   the SCSS masterfile.  Examples of variable lists are 

                  AGE 
                  AGE, SEX, RACE
                  FRATMEM TO PROFMEM, EDUC, SES 

        VARIABLES=$varlist 

   If the variable name or variable list is prefaced  with  a  dollar  sign
   ($),  listed variables are kept in their raw as opposed to recoded form. 
   The SPSS variable names will not include the initial  dollar  sign.   As 
   with  the simple variable list, the TO convention may be used.  However,
   both variable names  must  be  prefaced  with  a  dollar  sign  and  all 
   variables  implied  are  considered  dollar sign variables.  Examples of
   dollar variable lists are

                  $AGE
                  $AGE, $SEX, $RACE 
                  $FRATMEM TO $PROFMEM, $EDUC, $SES 

   Simple and dollar variable lists may be mixed on the VARIABLES= card.

        VARIABLES=$ALL

   This specification is similar to ALL except that all  the  variables  on 
   the  SCSS  masterfile will be saved on the SPSS system file in their raw
   form rather than in their recoded form.  As  with  the  dollar  variable 
   list, the SPSS variable names will not include the initial dollar signs.

        spssvar=scssvar 

   The rename specification is made up of an SPSS variable name followed by
   an equals sign (=) and the name of a variable on  the  SCSS  masterfile. 
   The  name  following the equals sign may be prefixed by a dollar sign if 
   the raw values are to be kept.  The rename specification is  useful  for
   accessing  a variable whose name is an SPSS reserved word, for accessing
   a variable in both its raw and recoded forms, or for cosmetic  purposes.
   Examples of rename specifications are

                  SINTYPE = SIN 
                  RAWAGE = $AGE 
                  EDUC = V138 

   Note  that, regardless of which VARIABLES= specification is used, a file 
   which  was  weighted  under  SCSS  will  remain  weighted  under   SPSS. 
   Specifically, if the SCSS masterfile was weighted, the raw values of the 
   weighting variable will become the values of CASWGT under SPSS.  Whether


1 


   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 34


   or  not  the user also keeps the SCSS weighting variable does not affect 
   this automatic assignment.


   The MIS= Specification 

   When  an SCSS masterfile is transposed into an SPSS system file, several 
   types of problems may arise regarding the translation of missing  values
   from  one  system  to the other.  It is possible, for example, to define 
   more missing values for an SCSS variable than  SPSS  can  handle;  other 
   problems  may  arise  from the fact that missing values may be listed on
   variable masks (from which all information for the transposition process 
   is  read)  in  such a way as to make it impossible for SPSS to interpret 
   the raw values from the information on the mask,  when  raw  values  are
   requested.

   The  MIS=  specification  determines  the  manner  in which SCSS missing 
   values which cannot be represented in SPSS are to  be  handled.   It  is
   possible  to  request  that  these  values  be  left as is; that they be 
   recoded to SPSS-valid missing values; or that if encountered, they force
   the run to stop.  In all cases a report of the untranslatable values and 
   the reasons why they cannot be translated is printed at the end  of  the
   run.  (See Output from GET SCSS, described above). 

   There are three types of situations in which SCSS missing values may not
   be representable in SPSS. 

       -     Too many SCSS missing values% An SCSS variable may  have  more
             missing  value  specifications  than SPSS can handle.  This is 
             the case when an SCSS variable has  more  than  three  missing 
             values,  more than one missing value range, or a missing value
             range and more than one individual missing value. 
       -     Shuffled missing and valid SCSS values% If  the  mask  for  an
             SCSS  variable specifies a missing value range and a series of
             non-missing values within that range, it will not be  possible 
             to  transpose  the missing values directly into SPSS.  This is 
             due to the fact that in SPSS, it is not possible to specify  a
             value as non-missing.  Values in SPSS are marked as missing or 
             not marked at all.  Thus the values list on the SCSS  variable
             mask  which  specifies values first in a range as missing, and
             subsequently enumerates a series  of  them  as  valid  values, 
             cannot be transposed by the GET SCSS facility.  This situation
             may arise from such legitimate responses to the  SCSS  VALUES? 
             prompt as% 

                  VALUES?     0-9 (mis); 1,2,3,4,5,8,9 

             If  the missing values had been enumerated in the mask, rather
             than specified as a range (e.g., as  0,6,7(mis);1,2,3,4,5,8,9) 
             there would be no difficulty in transposing the variable.
       -     Alphabetic range of SCSS missing values% If the mask for an an 
             SCSS  variable  contains a range of alphabetic missing values,


1 


   Page 35                         SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982


             it will not be possible to retrieve the variable's  values  in
             their  raw form from the information on the mask.  This is due
             to the fact that the collating sequences used in SPSS and SCSS
             for  alphabetic values are different.  That is, the range 'AA' 
             thru 'ZZ' will include different intermediate values  in  SPSS 
             than it does in SCSS.  Notice that this problem can only occur 
             in the case of an attempt to access an alpha variable  in  its 
             raw form, since SCSS requires that all alpha values be recoded
             to numeric values in the variable mask.


   The  MIS=  specification provides three alternatives for the handling of 
   non-translatable SCSS missing values.  They are requested through use of
   MIS= keywords RECODE, LEAVE and STOP. 

        MIS=RECODE

   The  keyword  RECODE  is the MIS= default; specifying MIS=RECODE has the
   same effect as omitting the MIS= specification from the GET  SCSS  card.
   RECODE  specifies  that,  if  a  value  is  encountered  which  would be 
   considered missing by SCSS but cannot be represented in SPSS, it  is  to
   be  recoded  to  the  first of that variable's missing values considered
   legitimate by SPSS.  Note that, if the variable has a missing range, the
   output of this recoding process is the lower limit of that range. 

        MIS=LEAVE 

   Specification  of  this  keyword  results in the reporting of any values
   considered missing by SCSS but not by SPSS.  However, the values are not 
   recoded  and  therefore  are  not  considered missing in the SPSS system
   file.

        MIS=STOP

   If this keyword is specified, the researcher is informed of  any  values
   considered  missing  by  SCSS  but not by SPSS.  In addition, the values
   which would have resulted under the MIS=RECODE  treatment  are  printed,
   and  the  run  aborts  after  all the data have been read but before the 
   relatively time-consuming transposition itself.


   Output from GET SCSS

   After  the  GET  SCSS control card has been analyzed, the system reports
   the maximum number of variables which can be  accessed  with  the  given
   amount  of  memory,  the number of variables requested (including CASWGT 
   but not SEQNUM or SUBFILE), the file name (which should be the  same  as
   the SCSS internal file name), and the number of cases in the file.

   Also  included  in  the  output  is  a  report  of  SCSS  variables with 
   non-translatable missing values and  warning  messages  indicating  that 
   variables with names invalid in SPSS have been dropped.


1 


   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 36


   During the processing of the data from the SCSS masterfile,  the  system
   checks  for  problems  in the handling of missing values and a report is
   printed.  This report includes the names of all variables whose  missing 
   values present a problem to SPSS, the type of problem, the result value,
   and the first 50 problem values encountered.  The problems  are  denoted
   in shorthand form as follows%

        TOO MANY

   This message is printed if the SCSS variable has more than three missing
   values, more than one missing value range, or a missing value range  and
   more than one individual missing value. 

        OVERLAP 

   This  message  indicates  the  existence  of a missing value range which 
   includes non-missing values. 

        ALF RNGE

   This message indicates the presence of values which are included  in  an 
   alphabetic range of missing values under SCSS.

   Under  the  column  in  the missing value report headed RESULT VALUE are
   printed the values produced by the automatic recoding  unless  MIS=LEAVE 
   was  specified.   If  the  result values are themselves missing, as they 
   normally are, the values are followed by the letter M.  The  absence  of
   the  letter M indicates that the variable has no missing values and that 
   problem values are recoded to the lower limit of  a  range  which  would 
   have  been  missing  under  SCSS.   Occurrences  of  the situation where
   recoding to a missing value is impossible will be  quite  rare  and  are 
   accompanied by the following warning at the end of the report%

        WARNING - SOME SCSS MISSING VALUES ARE NO LONGER MISSING. 

   During  the  processing of the GET SCSS control card, several conditions
   may be detected which result in warning  messages  rather  than  errors.
   These  conditions are reported to the researcher, and the run continues. 
   The specific warning messages are% 

   VARIABLE 'xxxxxxxx' IS  SCSS-SPECIFIC  AND  IS  DROPPED.   This  message 
   indicates  that  the  user  either  specifically  or  thru use of the TO 
   convention attempted to access a variable which has meaning only to  the 
   SCSS  system,  e.g.,  SPSS  or  SPSS0001.  As indicated, the variable is
   simply not retained for processing.

   'xxxxxxxx' IS A RESERVED WORD AND IS  DROPPED.   This  message  will  be 
   issued  if  the  user  attempts  to access a variable (without renaming)
   whose name is considered a reserved word within SPSS.  This circumstance
   is most likely to arise in the case of arithmetic function names such as
   SIN, COS, EXP, etc., which are considered reserved words within SPSS but
   not  within  SCSS.   The message will also occur if the result name in a


1 


   Page 37                         SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982


   rename specification is an SPSS reserved word.

   'xxxxxxxx' ALREADY EXISTS AND IS DROPPED.  This message results from  an
   attempt  to access a variable by a name which has already been included. 
   The situation is particularly likely to arise from an attempt to  access
   a  variable  with  the  same  name  as an SPSS automatic variable, i.e.,
   SEQNUM, SUBFILE or CASWGT. 


   File and Memory Management for GET SCSS 

   From  a  mechanical  point  of  view,  GET SCSS transposes the data on a
   variable-ordered SCSS masterfile to arrive at a  temporary  case-ordered 
   data file which may be accessed by SPSS.  The transposition is performed 
   with the data resident on a random access scratch file.  GET  SCSS  uses
   as much memory as possible for transposition to minimize processing time 
   and scratch file space, subject to  the  constraint  that  it  does  not 
   exceed the maximum field length allowable.  The field length and scratch
   file size required for transposition are always printed by GET SCSS.  An
   EDIT  run should be used to determine how much memory and disk space are 
   required for a transposition without suffering  the  possibly  expensive
   consequences of running out of mass storage.

   The  size  of  the  scratch  file  used  for  transposition is inversely
   proportional to the field  length  available  to  GET  SCSS.   The  more
   central  memory  available,  the smaller the scratch file will be, up to 
   the point where all the data will fit into memory.  If you have  a  file
   with a large number of variables and cases, you can specify MF=320000 in 
   an EDIT run to find the optimal  field  length  and  scratch  file  size 
   needed for transposition.

   GUTTMAN

   The  restrictions  for  the  GUTTMAN scaling procedure have been changed
   from a maximum of 50 scales with 12 items per scale to a maximum  of  12
   scales with 50 items per scale (SPSS, page 537).

   GUTTMAN  now  accepts  variable lists (for example, VAR01 TO VAR10(3) ).
   Previously, each  variable  and  its  cutting  point  had  to  be  named
   separately.

   An  alternate  output format may be requested via OPTION 4.  This OPTION 
   causes the item by scale score matrix to be printed in  the  form  of  a 
   scalogram.   As  with  the  default format, scale scores are ranked from 
   high to low along the rows, and the items are ranked from  high  to  low 
   (according  to  frequency)  along  the columns.  With OPTION 4, however,
   only the positive response frequencies appear in each cell (NOTE  -  For 
   each  item,  the positive response corresponds to values greater than or
   equal to the specified cutting point).  This  format  necessarily  omits 
   some  information  that  is available using the standard format, but the 
   resulting table is considerably easier to read.  If  the  items  form  a 
   Guttman  scale,  the  item  by score matrix will consist of a triangular
   pattern of entries such as the following%


                                  ITEM

   OPTION 4 is forced if a scale consists of more than 12 items. 


   INPUT FORMAT 

   The keyword FIXED is not required on the INPUT FORMAT card. 

   Coded  Input  -  For  standard  FORTRAN  type  files  (e.g.,  CRM format
   BT=C,RT=Z), the maximum record size is  148  characters.   This  can  be 
   expanded  to any size desired through the use of RL=nnn parameter on the 
   SPSS call card.  For standard files on any medium (disk, I, or SI tapes)
   the  RL  parameter can be calculated by taking the maximum record length
   in characters, adding 2, and then rounding up (if need be)  to  yield  a
   multiple  of  10.  For example, maximum record lengths of 147, 148, 149,
   and  150  would  require  RL  parameters  of  150,  150,  160,  and  160 
   respectively.   Since the default RL value is 150, this explains why for
   standard files the default maximum record size is 148 characters.

   For data files on fixed block S or L tapes the exact  record  length  in 
   characters  should  be given as the RL parameter.  In addition, for data
   files on fixed block  L  tapes,  the  maximum  block  length  should  be
   specified with the BL parameter.

   Binary Input - The format list with INPUT FORMAT BINARY is not supported
   (SPSS, page 47). 

   When INPUT FORMAT BINARY is used, the following should be noted% 

       1.   The file is assumed to have exactly as many words per  case  as 
            there are variables in the VARIABLE LIST. 

       2.   Records  may  be  unblocked  (each  case  is a separate logical 
            record) or blocked (one logical  record  contains  all  of  the
            cases).   No  special  instruction  has to be given to indicate 
            which type of file is being used. 

       3.   The file is assumed to contain no special flag  words,  control
            words,  or record counts.  Under KRONOS 2.1, SCOPE 3.4, or NOS,
            the following sequence can be used  to  write  file  lfn  in  a 
            format  which  SPSS  can  read  with  the  INPUT  FORMAT BINARY
            specification. 

                  FTN.
                  FILE,lfn,BT=C,RT=S.
                  LDSET,FILES=lfn. 
                  LGO.

             For users of SCOPE 3.3 and other older operating systems,  the
             standard  form  of  binary  output  from  FORTRAN  programs is 
             suitable to SPSS.  If the FTNBIN feature is used to produce  a
             blocked binary file, then each data case will actually contain 
             an extra word (record length) at the beginning  of  the  case.

             Therefore,  an  extra  (dummy) variable should be named as the 
             first variable in the variable list. 

       4.   The INTERNAL specification for BT=I,RT=W binary  files  is  not 
            available in Release 8.3.


   INPUT MEDIUM 

   The INPUT MEDIUM statement is not needed or recommended in SPSS-6000. 

   It  is  redundant to say INPUT MEDIUM CARD, since the program assumes by
   default that raw data and  matrix  cards  are  included  with  the  SPSS 
   statements  (regardless  of  whether  these  are  on  INPUT or on a file 
   designated by the I= parameter). 

   Where raw data or matrix cards are not included in  the  SPSS  statement 
   file,  the  D=  and  M=  parameters  provide  more  flexibility than the
   INPUT MEDIUM command, since the source or origin of the raw data and the
   matrix can be specified independently.  This means that either (or both)
   can be on a separate file, and if both, they  can  be  on  the  same  or
   different files. 

   However,  the  INPUT MEDIUM  command is legal and may be used instead of 
   the D= or M= parameter.  The lfn of the raw data or matrix  file  should
   be  entered in the specification field in this case.  The keywords TAPE, 
   DISK, or OTHER (SPSS, page 40) should not be used.

   The D= (or M=) parameter if present overrides the INPUT MEDIUM card. 


   JFACTOR

   The limitations and additions described for FACTOR apply (see page 23 of
   this document).  Note that OPTION 4 (matrix input of factor loadings) is 
   not available in JFACTOR.


   LAG Command

   The LAG control card (pages 280-283 of UPDATE)  is  not  available.   In
   SPSS-6000  the  LAG  function  (see page 9 of this document) provides an 
   equivalent capability.

   MANOVA 

   See Chapter One of UPDATE, pages 1-77.


   In abbreviated batch or online format (see page 83 of this document) the
   95 percent confidence interval for the group mean is not printed as part 
   of PRINT = CELLINFO(MEANS).


   The version of SPSS-MANOVA available in SPSS-6000 release 8.3 differs in 
   several  ways  from  the version documented in UPDATE.  Principally, the 
   changes consist of additional or modified features.  There  are  also  a 
   few  corrections  required  to  the  UPDATE  documentation  for existing
   features.  This section presents the corrections first, then  the  extra
   features.

   Corrections

   Section  1.13 describes the Decomposition matrix.  This matrix is formed
   using either the Cholesky or Householder factorization procedure of  the 
   original design matrix (see Section 1.67).  The decomposition matrix for
   both methods  is  upper  triangular,  but  the  lower  triangle  of  the 
   Householder  decomposition  contains  a factored form of the orthonormal 
   design matrix.  The  Cholesky  lower  triangle  always  contains  zeros.
   SPSS-6000   MANOVA  labels  the  matrices  as  either  the  Cholesky  or
   Householder   decomposition   to   avoid   the   confusing   "Triangular
   Decomposition" labelling which appears in Figure 1.15c. 

   Section  1.16  of  UPDATE  describes the use of orthogonal contrasts for
   unequal numbers of replicates.  This section  only  applies  to  one-way
   designs, which is not stated explicitly in the text of that section.  Of 
   course, since any multi-factor design can be analyzed as if  it  were  a
   one-way  design (given the proper contrast matrix), the techniques apply 
   to such designs.  However, the orthogonality  of  contrasts  is  not  as
   important   in  multi-factor  designs.   Generally,  careful  choice  of 
   comparisons combined with judicious use of unique  sums-of-squares  (see
   SSTYPE(UNIQUE)   in   Section  1.68)  is  a  more  useful  approach  for 
   multi-factor designs.

   There is also an error on page 12 in Section 1.16.  The  statement  that 
   the  F-tests  resulting  from  this  procedure  are  independent  is not
   correct.  The numerators of the F-tests are independent, but the F-tests 
   themselves are dependent.

   Paragraph 4 of Section 1.33 describes the averaged F-test.  This test is
   generally useful only if the dependent variables have  been  transformed
   using  orthonormal  contrasts.  In the example given it appears only for
   completeness, not because it is actually meaningful for the given data.

   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 44


   The output format of the averaged F-tests has been changed in SPSS-6000. 
   If  an  automatic  repeated-measures  analysis  is being performed using
   ANALYSIS(REPEATED) (see Sections 1.43 through 1.49)  then  the  averaged 
   F-tests  will  be  collected and presented in a separate table using the 
   usual SPSS-MANOVA format for univariate results.  For  doubly-multivari- 
   ate   repeated-measures  designs  in  which  the  averaged  F-tests  are 
   themselves multivariate, the usual  multivariate-style  output  will  be
   produced  for  the  averaged F-tests after the output for the unaveraged
   multivariate tests.  If ANALYSIS(REPEATED) does  not  appear,  then  the 
   output  is  as  described  in  paragraph  4.   Also see the new features 
   section below for a description of the PRINT = SIGNIF( AVONLY )  feature
   which allows suppression of the non-averaged results. 

   The  short  multivariate  output produced by PRINT=SIGNIF(BRIEF) differs 
   from that shown in Figure 1.33e.  The averaged F is no  longer  produced
   as  part  of  that  table.   Instead,  the degrees of freedom for Wilks'
   Lambda appear.

   Section 1.36 describing Box's M  Test  should  note  that  the  test  is
   conducted only for cells with non-singular variance-covariance matrices. 

   Sections 1.43 through 1.49 about repeated-measures should specify that a
   new ANALYSIS(REPEATED) needs to appear after each new WSDESIGN.

   In Section 1.49 the brief statement about repeated-measures designs with 
   covariates  needs  further  clarification.  SPSS-MANOVA demands that the
   within-cases design be complete when the multivariate approach is  used. 
   Hence,  even  if  covariates  do not vary over trials, a covariate value 
   must be inserted for each level of  the  trial  factors.   For  example, 
   assume that the example of Section 1.49 also contained a covariate value 
   measured only prior to the first trial -- say, variable COVAR.  Then, in 
   order  to  satisfy  the  completeness  requirement,  we  would  need  to
   duplicate COVAR for each level of the trial factors.   We  can  do  this 
   most  conveniently  using  the  DO  REPEAT feature.  The resulting setup
   would look like this% 

        1              16 
        DO REPEAT      C = COV1 TO COV9/
        COMPUTE        C = COVAR
        END REPEAT

        MANOVA         Y1 TO Y9 BY NOISE(1,2) WITH COV1 TO COV9/

                       WSFACTORS = PERIOD(3), DIAL(3)/
                       WSDESIGN  = PERIOD DIAL PERIOD BY DIAL/

                       PRINT = SIGNIF( BRIEF AVERF )/ 

                       ANALYSIS(REPEATED)/
                       DESIGN = NOISE

   When the covariate(s) do vary over the  trials  the  unaveraged  results
   must be interpreted cautiously.  This is because there will generally be
   a non-zero regression of the covariate values from the  time  period  in
   which  that  covariate  is  measured  to  the  dependent  variable value
   measured at another time period.  For example, covariate adjustment  for 
   time 1 will be performed using covariate values taken at time periods 2,
   3, and so on.  This is not usually a  desirable  property.   SPSS-MANOVA 
   does   not  currently  implement  the  restricted  estimation  technique
   required to correct for this situation. 

   The data in table 1.50 should include one more (Y,X) pair  in  the  A=3, 
   B=2 cell% Y=8, X=4.

   The explanation of adjusted and predicted means on page 53 requires some 
   augmentation.   The  predicted  mean  is  computed  by  multiplying  the
   corresponding  row  of  the  design  matrix  by  the parameter estimates 
   adjusted for covariates, if any.  The adjusted mean adds the sum of  the
   product  of  the covariate values and the regression coefficients to the 
   predicted mean. 

   In designs with empty cells or redundancies, the values  calculated  for 
   the  estimated  and  adjusted  means  may  not  be reasonable.  A better 
   approach in this case is  to  request  the  predicted  observations  via 
   PUNCH = POBS  and then make a second SPSS run using the resultant BCDOUT 
   output with BREAKDOWN to produce the adjusted means.

   Note  that  the  raw  residuals  produced  by  PRINT = PMEANS  are   the 
   differences  between the observed means and the estimated means, not the 
   adjusted means.  The standardized residuals  are  computed  by  dividing
   each  raw  residual by the error standard deviation of the corresponding 
   dependent variable.  Thus, the residuals can be visually compared across
   variables.   However,  this  form  of  the  standardized residual is not
   distributed as Student's t. 

   The first paragraph on page 54  indicates  that,  with  covariates,  the 
   ERROR(error term)  subphrase  of the PMEANS keyword must be specified in
   order to obtain the predicted means.  In SPSS-6000, if no error term  is 
   chosen,  then the current default error term will automatically be used.
   This also holds for the PRINT=POBS phrase. 

   The standardized residuals computed when PRINT=POBS is requested are the 
   raw  residuals  divided  by  the  adjusted  standard  deviation  of  the 
   dependent variable.  Again,  these  residuals  are  not  distributed  as 
   Student's t.

   Sections 1.82 through 1.86 do not describe the PUNCH= phrase  as  it  is 
   currently   implemented  in  SPSS-6000.   CELLINFO  can  take  only  two 
   arguments% COR and COV.  The cell means and counts are  always  written. 
   The order in which the quantities are output is% 

                   cell-identifier of first cell 
                     cell means for first cell 
                   cell-identifier of second cell 
                     cell means for second cell 
                                    . 
                                    . 
                   cell-identifier of last cell 
                     cell means for last cell 
                     blank cards signalling end-of-cell information.

                     more than 8 grouping factors, two blank records) 
                   cell counts
                   pooled within-cells error matrix 
                   optional within-cells standard deviations 
                     (when error correlations read)


   The formats are% 

        Matrix           Format 
        ------           ------ 
        cell id's       (8I10  )

        COV             (8G10.5)
        std. devs.      (8G10.5) 

   The  data  generated  by CELLINFO is suitable for input using the INPUT=
   phrase described later.

   The output format for the ERROR matrices is (8G10.5).

   New Features

   There  are  several  features  present in SPSS-6000 MANOVA which are not 
   documented in UPDATE 7-9.  These include% 

        (1)  Summary input via INPUT= 
        (2)  Naming of repeated-measures via MEASURES 
        (3)  Some additional PRINT keywords
        (4)  The INNERPROD keyword of the METHODS phrase



   Using Summary Data as Input 

   Subprogram  MANOVA  permits  entry  of  summary data in the form of cell
   means, counts, and variance-covariance matrices.  This  feature  enables
   analysis  of  data  from  such  sources as research papers or textbooks, 
   where the data frequently appear only in summary form.

   The INPUT phrase provides the mechanism by which  summary  data  may  be
   used.   Specifying  INPUT=SUMMARY  causes MANOVA to look for the summary 
   data following a READ MATRIX statement.  The following  examples  illus-
   trate how one might use this feature.

   The  first  example in Figure 1 shows how to provide summary input for a 
   univariate problem.  The data is the same  as  that  of  Figure  1.2  in
   UPDATE.   The  information  in  brackets '[]' is only to label the input 
   lines and would not appear in an actual run.

   In the multivariate case there is a vector of means for each cell -- one
   mean  for  each  interval variable -- and the pooled variance is entered 
   either as a variance-covariance matrix or a correlation matrix  followed
   by  a  vector of standard deviations.  Only the lower triangle, by rows, 
   of the matrix is entered.  Each row of the matrix begins on a new  input 
   record.  For example, consider this 4 x 4 correlation matrix% 

        (  1.0   0.5   0.3  -0.2 )
        (  0.5   1.0  -0.4   0.8 )

        ( -0.2   0.8   0.6   1.0 )

   If this matrix were being input as summary data to SPSS MANOVA, then  it 
   would appear as follows%

   The general form of the INPUT statement is% 

                  INPUT   =  RAW
                            - or -            [COV] 
                             SUMMARY [(ERROR( [COR] ) )]

                             MISSING = [ LISTWISE ] 
                                       [ IGNORE   ]       / 

   RAW  (default)  indicates that the input consists of the complete series
   of observations for each of the variables in the design along  with  the 
   associated values of the grouping factors for each observation.

   SUMMARY  indicates  that summary data is used.  Summary data consists of 
   these items% 

        1. the cell identifier -- the values of the factors for this cell. 
        2. the cell means -- the means for each of the interval variables
           in this cell.
        3. For all cells together, the cell counts.
        4. The within-cells error correlation or variance-covariance 
           matrix.

   ERROR indicates the form of the pooled within-cells error%

            COV       the variance/covariance matrix (default)
            COR       the correlation matrix with standard deviations 
                      following in a separate vector. 

   MISSING  =  IGNORE  requests SPSS MANOVA to ignore all missing-value de-
   clarations, and all cases are included in the computations.  This is the
   same as specifying OPTION 1.  MISSING = LISTWISE is the default. 

   Summary data must be placed after a READ MATRIX statement.  The order in 
   which data must appear is as follows%

                   READ MATRIX
                   cell-identifier of first cell 
                     cell means for first cell 
                   cell-identifier of second cell 
                     cell means for second cell 
                                    . 
                                    . 
                   cell-identifier of last cell 
                     cell means for last cell 
                     blank cards signalling end-of-cell information.

                     more than 8 grouping factors, two blank records) 
                   cell counts
                   pooled within-cells error matrix

   Each row of any input matrix or vector must begin on a new record.   The
   following  table provides the fixed format specifications for all matrix 
   entries%

        Matrix           Format 
        ------           ------ 
        cell id's       (8I10  ) 
        means           (8G10.5) 
        counts          (8G10.0)
        COR             (8G10.5)
        COV             (8G10.5)
        std. devs.      (8G10.5) 

   Use  of  summary input precludes requests for predicted observations, as
   both raw and summary  data  cannot  currently  be  used  simultaneously. 
   Also, homogeneity of variances/dispersions tests cannot be performed.

   One  final note% if no factor appears in the MANOVA statement, then only 
   the pooled input should appear.

   MEASURES 

   The MEASURES phrase provides for naming repeated-measures  so  that  the 
   labelling  of  the  averaged  significance  tests will be improved.  The
   general syntax is%

        MEASURES = measure-names /

   One measure name should be given to  each  set  of  dependent  variables
   making  up  a  single repeated-measure set.  For example, assume we have 
   three variables X, Y, and Z repeated four times.  The SPSS-MANOVA  setup
   might look as follows% 

        MANOVA         X1, X2, X3, X4, Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4,
                       Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4 BY GROUP(1,3)/

                       WSFACTOR = TRIAL(4)/ 

                       MEASURES = X, Y, Z/

                       WSDESIGN / 
                       ANALYSIS(REPEATED)/


   If the MEASURES= phrase does not appear, then default measure names  are
   generated as follows%

       1.   If all of the names for a given variable set corresponding to a 
            particular repeated measure have  the  same  alphabetic  prefix 
            with  a  numeric suffix, then the common alphabetic prefix will
            be used as the measure name.

   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 52


            Examples%

                  Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4 --> Y
                  VAR1, VAR2, VAR6, VAR8 --> VAR

       2.   When  the  variable  names do not follow the above pattern then
            names of the  form  MEAS.n,  where  n  is  a  number,  will  be 
            generated. 

            Example%

                  PREDIS, POSTDIS, FOLODIS --> MEAS.1 


   NOTE% A new ANALYSIS(REPEATED) must follow each new  WSDESIGN  in  order
   for this labelling to work properly. 

   New PRINT= Keywords 

   Two new PRINT= keywords have been added. 

   PRINT=TRANSFORM  requests that the transformation matrix of the interval 
   variables be printed.

   PRINT = SIGNIF( AVONLY ) requests that  only  the  averaged  results  be 
   printed  for  a  repeated-measures analysis of variance.  The unaveraged
   results will not be printed.  Use of this option prevents calculation of 
   predicted means or observations. 

   Note  that  SIGNIF( AVONLY ) is only honored for automatic repeated-mea-
   sures analyses, i.e., ANALYSIS(REPEATED) must be specified.

   INNERPROD

   SPSS-6000 MANOVA performs most computations,  including  inner-products, 
   in  single-precision,  except  where extremely high accuracy is known in 
   advance to be needed (e.g., the  computation  of  orthogonal  polynomial
   coefficients).   Sometimes  it may be desirable to force the computation
   of inner products to be done using  double-precision  arithmetic.   This 
   can be done by using the INNERPROD keyword of the METHODS= phrase.

   Specify   METHODS  =  INNERPROD(DOUBLE)  to  cause  SPSS-MANOVA  to  use 
   double-precision inner products. 

   Note% Use of INNERPROD(DOUBLE) can substantially increase the cost of  a
   MANOVA run.

   Matrix Input

   Matrix  input  may  be  from  a  file other than the SPSS statement file
   (which is either INPUT or the file designated with  the  I=  parameter). 
   The  local file name of the file on which the matrix resides is conveyed
   to SPSS via a parameter on the SPSS call card, of the form% M=lfn. 


   Maximum Number of Variables 

   The maximum number of variables of an SPSS file is 1000 in SPSS-6000.


   Memory Requirements

   The field length needed to load and begin execution  of  SPSS-6000  will 
   vary  somewhat  from  one  computing center to another.  At Northwestern
   University, 54000 CM is needed.  Once loaded, SPSS-6000  handles  memory
   management  in  a  dynamic  fashion;  that is, it computes the amount of 
   memory required and  allocates  it  automatically.   The  WORKSPACE  and 
   TRANSPACE  calculations  given  in  the  SPSS and UPDATE manuals are not 
   applicable to SPSS-6000.  However, it is sometimes necessary to know how
   much  CM  will  be needed for a job.  In particular, before submitting a
   large job, it is prudent to determine if the job  will  run  within  the 
   memory limits of the machine.

   Unlike  other  SPSS-6000  procedures,  DISCRIMINANT,  REPORT,  and  MULT
   RESPONSE cannot manage memory in a dynamic fashion.  The SET CM  control 
   card  can be used to allocate a static amount of memory for the duration 
   of the procedure following  it.   See  page  77  of  this  document  for 
   information about SET CM.

   The easiest and most accurate way to estimate memory requirements for an 
   SPSS-6000 job is to use the EDIT facility.  An EDIT run, in addition  to
   checking the syntax of SPSS control cards, also prints the CM needed and
   terminates with an error if the  required  CM  exceeds  the  maximum  CM
   available.   (NOTE  -  In  an EDIT run, MANOVA, NONPAR CORR, NPAR TESTS,
   PLOT, SCATTERGRAM,  SURVIVAL,  SPECTRAL  and  the  general  versions  of
   FREQUENCIES,  CROSSTABS  and  BREAKDOWN cannot determine the exact field
   length that will be needed.  Thus, EDIT cannot be used  to  ensure  that
   sufficient  CM  is  available  to the job.  However, these procedures do 
   report the maximum number of cases that can be processed).

   The maximum field length available for an SPSS run will  vary  from  one 
   computing  center  to  another,  and  in  addition may depend upon other
   factors such as the time of day,  what  type  of  account  the  user  is
   running  under,  and  so  forth.   At  run-time SPSS-6000 determines the
   maximum field length available to the SPSS job step, and uses this as an 
   upper  limit  in  allocating memory if the MF= parameter is not given on 
   the SPSS call card.  That is, the default maximum is the actual  maximum
  

1 


   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 54


   available (to the job step).

   However,  the  Maximum  Field  length parameter, MF=, can be employed to
   override the default and specify a  different  upper  limit.   SPSS-6000 
   takes the field length entered with the MF= parameter as the upper limit
   on the amount of memory it can allocate.  (If the value entered is  less 
   than the minimum memory needed to load and begin execution, the required 
   minimum instead of the specified value  becomes  the  upper  limit.   As 
   noted  above  the  minimum field length for execution at Northwestern is 
   54000 CM.) 

   The upper limit used for an SPSS run is printed on the banner page, with 
   the legend "MAXIMUM FIELD LENGTH REQUEST".

   In  general  SPSS  should be called without the MF= parameter, to permit
   allocation of memory up to the job step maximum, or  the  MF=  parameter
   should  be  used  to restrict the allocation of memory to a field length
   less than the job step maximum. 

   Note that it is possible to specify (with the MF=  parameter)  an  upper
   limit  greater  than  the  maximum available to the job step.  A warning 
   message is printed in this case.   Since  SPSS-6000  will  abort  if  it
   attempts  to  allocate  more  memory than is actually available, this is
   typically only done in an EDIT run for a large job.


   MERGE FILES (also GET ARCHIVE) 

   See page 25 of this document.


   MISSING VALUES 

   The value -0 (or the keyword BLANK) cannot be used as the upper or lower 
   bound  of a value range specification.  (See Blanks and Zeros, page 6 of
   this document, and UPDATE, pages 314-315.) 


   MULT RESPONSE

   See Chapter 8 of UPDATE, pages 240-247. 

   The PAIRED option (pages 244-246) has not been implemented in SPSS-6000. 
   Option  6  (page  246) limits the output width to 80 characters, not 75. 
   This option is the default in SPSS/ONLINE.

   The amount of memory required for MULT RESPONSE (UPDATE,  page  247)  is
   dependent on three quantities which are summed together. 

       1.   For  each multiple response item defined in the GROUPS= list, 4 
            words are required. 



1 

  
   Page 55                         SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982


       2.   For each frequency table (NCAT + 1) words are  required,  where
            NCAT is the number of categories or dichotomies to be included. 

       3.   For  each crosstab table determine the number of categories (or
            dichotomies as the case may be) for each  dimension.   For  the 
            first  two  dimensions,  add  one  to the number of categories.
            Then multiply the resulting numbers together.  That is,  for  a
            2 x 3 x 4 table, you would multiply
                            (2 + 1) * (3 + 1) * 4 = 48. 
            This gives you the number of words needed for the table.
            A quick and relatively accurate estimate  can  be  obtained  by
            adding  one  to  the number of categories in each dimension and 
            multiplying these numbers together.

   The procedure uses whatever space is left over for category labels.  For
   frequency tables, each category label requires 4 words, and for crosstab
   tables, each requires 2 words.  If there is insufficient space  for  all 
   the  category  labels  for  a  given table, some are simply left off the 
   output.  If this happens and complete labelling is  desirable,  the  job
   can be resubmitted with a larger field length specified on a SET CM card 
   immediately preceding the MULT RESPONSE card. 


   N OF CASES 

   N OF CASES cannot be omitted or UNKNOWN  (see  UPDATE,  page  285)  when 
   matrix  input  is  used  or  with  the  SURVIVAL,  SPECTRAL or NONLINEAR 
   procedures (which need the number of cases to allocate memory). 



   N OF CASES and SUBFILE LIST 

   An  additional  restriction  (UPDATE,  page 286) is that neither card is
   allowed (after subfiles have been defined,  by  a  prior  N OF CASES  or
   SUBFILE LIST,  or  through  GET FILE or GET ARCHIVE or by SORT CASES) if
   there has been a DELETE SUBFILES on this run.


   NONPAR CORR

   OPTION 7, which provides for random sampling, is available.  See UPDATE,
   page 315, Section 19.30.

   NPAR TESTS 

   See Chapter 7 of UPDATE, pages 220-239. 

   The following tests are also available%

   BINOMIAL TEST

   DATA SCALE%    Dichotomous (2 valued), or data that can be  dichotomized
                  (nominal, ordinal or interval). 

   DATA ORGANIZATION%    One sample (one variable).

   TYPE OF TEST%  Goodness of fit.  For data in two categories, the test is 
   for whether or not a significant difference exists between the  expected
   number in each category and the number actually observed.  If the number 
   of cases expected in each category is not the same,  a  test  proportion 
   may be specified.

   METHOD%  The  frequencies  for  the  two  categories are counted.  If no
   proportion has been specified to test against,  0.5  is  assumed  and  a 
   2-tailed probability is computed.  If a test proportion (unequal to 0.5) 
   is specified, a 1-tailed probability is computed.  The probability given
   is that of drawing a more extreme sample from a population with the test
   proportion.

   SPECIFICATION% 
                                             (cutting point)
             BINOMIAL [(p)] = variable list      - or -       /
                                             (value1, value2) 

   p  is the proportion of cases expected in the first category; if absent,
      0.5 is assumed.

   The two categories are defined by either% 

     1)   a cutting point, where the first category is made up of all cases 
          where  the  value  of  the  variable is less than or equal to the 
          cutting point, the second category is the remainder of the cases;
          or, 

     2)   two  values, where the first category is all cases which have the 
          value 'value1' and the second is all cases which have  the  value
          'value2'.

   STATISTICS  PROVIDED% Total cases, number of cases in each category, the
   test proportion, and the probability level.

   INTERPRETATION% A small  probability  level  indicates  that  the  group 
   proportions differ from the expected proportions tested against.

   KENDALL COEFFICIENT OF CONCORDANCE% W

   DATA SCALE%    Ordinal 

   DATA ORGANIZATION%    N entities (variables), k judges (cases)

   TYPE OF TEST% Agreement of judges in their ranking of the entities.  The
   W  coefficient  is  a  measure  of  how  the  cases  agree on the set of
   variables, and it varies between zero and one% zero means no  agreement;
   one  means  perfect  agreement.   The  test  of  significance  for  W is
   essentially the same as the Friedman test described on UPDATE, page 230.
   The only difference is that a correction for ties is made when computing
   chi-square for testing Kendall's W.   (Note  that  we  use  the  unusual 
   notation  of  N  variables  and  k  cases here; this was done to make it
   easier to follow Siegel's description of the test.  It  should  also  be
   noted  that  it  is  sometimes  desirable  to  perform  a test where the
   variables are the judges and the cases are the entities.   For  example,
   where  the  cases are students and the variables are scores on different
   tests, one might want to compute W for  testing  the  agreement  of  the
   various  tests.   To  perform  a  test  like  this  with  the NPAR TESTS 
   procedure, the data matrix would have to be transposed so that there  is 
   one  data case for each test, with each student made a separate variable 
   within the cases.) 

   METHOD% For each case, the N variables are ranked 1 to N.  The mean rank
   over all of the cases is computed for each variable.  From them, W and a
   corresponding chi-square statistic are computed. 

   SPECIFICATION% 
                     KENDALL = variable list/ 

   One test is performed, using all named variables as the set of entities.

   STATISTICS  PROVIDED%  The  mean  rank  for each variable; the number of 
   cases, S, the sum of mean squared deviations; W,  the  chi-square  value
   and degrees of freedom, and significance level. 

   INTERPRETATION%  A  small  significance level indicates that the ranking
   patterns are consistent from case to case.


   The following additional OPTION is available (UPDATE, page 239). 

   OPTION 6.      Suppress variable labels.  This will  result  in  a  more
                  compact  output  format  for many tests.  (This option is 
                  set by default under SPSS/ONLINE.)

   ONEWAY 

   See Chapter 18 of UPDATE, pages 307-309.

   The improvements to the multiple-comparison  range  tests  described  in 
   Sections  18.1 and 18.2 of UPDATE have not yet been implemented.  Hence,
   we suggest use of OPTION 10 (use harmonic mean of cell sizes)  with  the
   LSD, LSDMOD, SCHEFFE, TUKEY, and TUKEYB comparison procedures.

   The following additional STATISTIC is available (SPSS, page 429).

   STATISTIC 4.   Print the random  effects  (Model  II)  estimate  of  the
                  between component variance.  This is computed as%

                     E(GCV)=(BETWEEN GROUPS MS-WITHIN GROUPS MS)/ 
                            (N**2-SUM of N(I)**2) / (N*(K-1)) 

                  where

                  N is the total number of cases 
                  N(I) is the number of cases in group I 
                  K is the number of groups

   This is an unbiased estimate of the variance and, while a  variance  can 
   never be negative, the algorithm used by ONEWAY can result in a negative
   value.  This can occur with a small number of cases or a  peculiar  data 
   set.  The estimate will be negative whenever the F-ratio for the overall 
   ANOVA is less than 1.0.

   The random effects measures printed via STATISTIC 2  are  based  on  the 
   Model  II  estimate  of  the  variance  of XBAR (the overall mean of the 
   variable analyzed), which in turn  is  based  on  the  estimate  of  the 
   between component variance.  The formula is%

                   VAR(XBAR) = (BETWEEN GROUPS MS)/N +
                               E(BCV)*SUM of N(I)/(N**2)

   Whenever E(BCV) is negative, zero is substituted and a  warning  message 
   is printed. 


   Order of Control Cards 

   The  order  in which SPSS statements must appear in the job deck is more 
   flexible than the sequence given in the McGraw-Hill manual  (SPSS,  page 
   541).  The following restrictions do apply.


       1.   The VARIABLE LIST card must  appear  before  the  INPUT  FORMAT
            card.   Both  of these cards (or the equivalent DATA LIST card) 


1 


   Page 59                         SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982


            should appear before  any  data  modifications,  labelling,  or
            statistical procedure cards. 

       2.   Temporary  (starred)  transformations  must  appear  after  all 
            permanent (non-starred) transformations.

       3.   Only temporary  transformations  can  appear  after  the  first
            statistical procedure card. 

       4.   DELETE  SUBFILES and ADD SUBFILES cannot appear after the first 
            statistical procedure.

       5.   Only one GET FILE, GET SCSS, GET ARCHIVE or MERGE FILES may  be
            used  in  a run.  Similarly, only one VARIABLE LIST, DATA LIST,
            ADD VARIABLES, ADD CASES, ADD DATA LIST, or ADD SUBFILES may be
            used in a given run. 

       6.   DELETE VARS and KEEP VARS cannot be used in the same run.


   Order of Evaluation of Data Selection Commands

   See  UPDATE, pages 275-276.  SAMPLE, SELECT IF, and REJECT IF (and their 
   starred equivalents) are executed in the sequence in which they occur in 
   the  job  deck.  It is therefore advisable to place these data selection 
   commands in front of data modification commands wherever possible, so as
   to  avoid  spending  extra  computer  time  (and  money)  doing RECODEs, 
   COMPUTEs, etc., on cases which are then dropped. 


   OSIRIS VARS

   The OSIRIS VARS feature is supported.  The dictionary  must  be  an  IBM 
   format, OSIRIS type 1 dictionary.  It must be written in binary, in byte 
   mode  (e.g.,  if  on  7-track  tape,  TRTCH=C  is  the  appropriate  IBM
   parameter).   The data and dictionary should be on a stranger tape; they
   can be on the same tape  as  long  as  the  dictionary  is  first.   The 
   dictionary  is assumed to be blocked with 1600 byte blocks; the data can 
   be blocked or unblocked.  The D (data file), RL (record length), and  OS
   (OSIRIS  dictionary)  parameters  of the SPSS call card must all be used 
   when the OSIRIS VARS feature is used.

   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 60


   A typical job would be% 

             1              16
             .
             .
             REQUEST(TAPE,D=HY,F=S,VSN=...) 
             ATTACH(SPSS,.... 
             SPSS(OS=TAPE,D=TAPE,RL=nnn) 
             7/8/9 End-of-Record 
             OSIRIS VARS
             .
             .
             6/7/8/9 End-of-Information 

   OSIRIS missing values are automatically translated into the  appropriate
   MISSING  VALUE specifications by OSIRIS VARS (see UPDATE, pages 314-315, 
   for a discussion of missing value ranges).  OSIRIS VARS does not support 
   OSIRIS type 3 or OSIRIS IV type 5 datasets.

   Section 12.7, page 286 of UPDATE does not apply to SPSS-6000 -- that is, 
   the dictionary of the  variables  extracted  from  the  OSIRIS  file  is
   printed.


   PARTIAL CORR 

   The following additional OPTION is available (SPSS, page 314). 

   OPTION 20.     Substitutes the mean for missing data when computing  the
                  correlation matrix.


   PEARSON CORR 

   The following additional OPTIONs are available (SPSS, page 284). 

   OPTION 7.      Causes temporary  means  to  be  used  in  computing  the
                  correlation  matrix.   This  is a computational technique
                  that guarantees a  higher  degree  of  accuracy,  at  the 
                  expense of central processor time (20 percent slower).

   OPTION 20.     Substitutes the mean for missing data when computing  the
                  correlation matrix.











1 


   Page 61                         SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982




   RAW OUTPUT UNIT

   The specification for RAW OUTPUT UNIT may be either  a  lfn  or  a  unit 
   number  n - in which case the lfn of the alternate output file is TAPEn.
   OUTPUT is also a legitimate lfn. 


   READ INPUT DATA

   READ  INPUT  DATA  may  be  used  without  a  statistical  procedure  in
   SPSS-6000.  This means that a LIST CASES may be obtained without doing a
   statistical analysis (SPSS, page 137).   When  used  alone,  LIST  CASES
   followed by a READ INPUT DATA card causes a separate pass of the data to
   be made. 


   RECODE 

   The CONVERT specification can be used to convert numbers which were read
   under  A-format  to floating point numbers.  In SPSS-6000 leading blanks
   and non-numeric values are  not  converted  as  described  in  the  SPSS 
   manual.   Leading  blanks  are ignored, so that '  9', ' 9', and '9' are 
   all converted to 9.  CONVERT will also convert a minus sign  (-)  to  11
   and a plus sign (+) to 12 if either appears as the only character in the 
   input field.  If an attempt is made to convert any other character,  the
   value  is set to blank (-0) and a warning message is printed (SPSS, page 
   93). 

   The number of variables which can be named or implied on the RECODE card 
   in  SPSS-6000  is  not  limited to 400; the upper limit depends upon the
   amount of memory which is available (SPSS, page 96). 


   REGRESSION 

   The SPSS-6000 version of REGRESSION  has  many  features,  OPTIONs,  and 
   STATISTICs  not  described in the SPSS Manual.  (Included among them are 
   many of the enhancements which were incorporated into the NEW REGRESSION
   procedure  of IBM SPSS).  These additions are summarized here, but users
   should see the REGRESSION Reference (7) for details. 

   There is an additional (optional) keyword on the REGRESSION card.
   The format of the REGRESSION call card is%

             1              16
             REGRESSION     METHOD = type / 
                            VARIABLES=... 

   The  METHOD  keyword  is  used to specify the type of variable selection 
   method ('type' may be BACKWARD, FORWARD or STEPWISE).  The default if no 


1 


   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 62


   METHOD is selected is FORWARD. 



   The following additional OPTIONs are available (SPSS, page 355)% 

   OPTION 13.     Suppress the plotting of cases with missing data. 

   OPTION 16.     Write  the  variance/covariance  matrix  of  unnormalized
                  coefficients  (B)  to  the  alternate  output file (e.g., 
                  BCDOUT).

   OPTION 17.     Write the normalized regression  coefficients  (BETA)  to
                  the alternate output file.

   OPTION 18.     Write the unnormalized regression coefficients (B) to the 
                  alternate output file. 

   OPTION 19.     Force the regression through the origin. 

   OPTION 20.     Substitute the mean for missing data when  computing  the 
                  correlation matrix.

   OPTION 21.     Print T, not F, in the step-by-step output. 
  

   When   OPTION   11   is  specified,  the  output  of  residuals  on  the
   raw-output-file is in a slightly different format  from  that  described 
   (SPSS, page 354, OPTION 10). 

   The following OPTIONs are not implemented (page 354). 

   OPTION 10.     Requests sequencing information in  each  record  on  the
                  raw-output-file. 

   OPTION 12.     Causes   output   of   standardized   Y-hat   values   on 
                  raw-output-file. 

   OPTION 14.     Suppresses printing of  axes  on  plots  of  standardized 
                  predictor vs.  standardized residual.




   The following additional STATISTICs are available (SPSS, page 356)%

   STATISTIC 8.   Print the estimated  variance/covariance  matrix  of  the
                  unnormalized regression coefficients. 

   STATISTIC 9.   Print the 95 percent confidence interval  table  for  the
                  unnormalized regression coefficients (B). 



1 


   Page 63                         SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982


   STATISTIC 10.  Print the 95 percent confidence interval  table  for  the
                  normalized regression coefficients (BETA).



   The following STATISTICs are enhanced (page 356)% 

   STATISTIC 4.   Plots all cases.

   STATISTIC 5.   Also prints VonNeumann ratio and an analysis of  runs  of
                  sign for the residuals.



   The following STATISTICs are not implemented (page 356).

   STATISTIC 6.   Plot  of   the   standardized   residuals   against   the
                  standardized Y-hat values. 

   STATISTIC 7.   Correlation matrix with the number of cases.


   Currently, when pairwise deletion of missing data is used, the number of 
   cases from which the degrees of freedom are calculated  is  the  minimum 
   number  of  cases  of  any  correlation  coefficient  in  the associated
   VARIABLES= list, not the REGRESSION design statement (page 353).

   In abbreviated batch and online format (see page 83  of  this  document)
   information  about  variables  which  are  not  in  the  equation is not 
   printed.  By default, the step-by-step output and the summary  table  is 
   suppressed  under  online  format  and the meaning of OPTIONs 6 and 7 is 
   reversed% OPTION 6 causes the step-by-step results to  be  printed,  and 
   OPTION 7 causes the summary table to be printed. 


   REJECT IF

   REJECT IF   is   the  logical  reverse  of  SELECT IF  and  provides  an 
   alternative way of  selectively  processing  cases.   The  control  card
   format is% 

             1              16
             REJECT IF      (logical expression) 
   or 
             *REJECT IF     (logical expression) 

   If the logical expression is true, the case will be  dropped  (effective 
   immediately)  and  additional  transformations if any are not processed.
   If the expression is false, the case is  not  dropped  and  the  program
   continues  to process transformation control cards, if any follow.  Thus 
   where multiple REJECT IFs are used,  a  true  condition  (the  rejection
   criterion  has  been  met)  on any one of them will cause the case to be


1 


   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 64


   dropped at that point. 

   See also Order of Evaluation of Data Selection Commands on  page  59  of
   this document, and SELECT IF, on page 77. 

   MISSING VALUE   indicators   are   ignored  in  evaluating  the  logical 
   expression on the REJECT IF card. 


   RELIABILITY

   See Chapter 9 of UPDATE, pages 248-267. 

   The following limitations apply (UPDATE, pages 261-262). 

       1.   No more  than  10  VARIABLES=  lists  may  appear  on  a  given
            RELIABILITY procedure card.

       2.   No  more than 50 SCALE (label)= lists may be defined on a given
            RELIABILITY procedure card.

       3.   A SCALE must consist of at least 3 variables.

       4.   The  maximum  number  of  variables  that  may   be   specified 
            (duplicates count as one each) on the combined VARIABLES= lists 
            is limited to 200.  If OPTION  14  is  specified,  the  maximum
            number of variables is 400.

       5.   The  maximum  number  of variables that may be specified on any
            given SCALE(label)= list is limited to 200.  If  OPTION  14  is 
            specified, the maximum number of variables is 400.

       6.   The  maximum  number  of  variables  referenced in the combined
            SCALE(label)=  lists  for  a  given  RELIABILITY  procedure  is 
            limited to 400.  (If a variable is duplicated in several lists,
            each occurrence counts as one.)  If OPTION 14 is specified, the 
            maximum is 1000. 

       7.   The  amount  of  SPACE required for the execution of subprogram
            RELIABILITY is determined by% 

            SPACE   = (TRIANGLE + MATRIX + 4*LABEL) 

            TRIANGLE = Summation over i of%  N(i) * (N(i)+1)/2,
                       where N(i) is the number of variables in the
                       ith variable list.

            MATRIX  = the larger of the two quantities%
                      summation over i of N(i)   or   MAX * (MAX+3), 
                      where MAX is the number of variables 
                      in the longest scale list. 



1 


   Page 65                         SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982


            LABEL   = 0 if OPTION 3 is specified, or 
                      summation over i of N(i) if OPTION 3 is not specified. 
   Exceptions% 

       1.   If only one scale list is specified TRIANGLE = 0. 

       2.   If too much core is required to do the analysis, the subprogram 
            will delete variable lists in the reverse order in  which  they
            were entered, until the allocated core is sufficient. 

       3.   If  OPTION 14 is used, the space is calculated according to the
            formula% 

            SPACE = 3*(NV+NSV+NS) + 4*LABEL 

            NV  = number of variables in the combined variable lists.

            NSV = number of variables in the combined scale lists.

            NS  = number of scales. 

            LABEL = 0 if OPTION 3 is specified, and NV if it is not. 

   In abbreviated batch or online format (see page 83 of this document) the
   squared multiple correlation is not printed as part of STATISTIC 9.


   RENAME VARS

   The  RENAME  VARS  feature  may  be  used to change variable names.  The
   statement format is%

             1              16
             RENAME VARS    variable list = name list 

   The list of variables to be renamed is entered to the left of the  equal 
   sign.   The  new  names  to  be assigned are entered to the right of the
   equal sign.  Names entered separately and the  use  of  the  alphaxx  TO
   alphayy convention may be freely intermixed. 

   The  first  new  name  from  name list is assigned to the first variable 
   mentioned in the variable list -- the  second  to  the  second,  and  so
   forth.  Thus the two lists must correspond in order and length.  SEQNUM,
   SUBFILE, and CASWGT may not be renamed.

   For example, a file contains the variables%

             A,B,C,D,E,F,RCIEPTS

   Renaming is called for as follows%




1 


   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 66


             1              16
             RENAME VARS    A,D TO F,RCIEPTS=TAX1 TO TAX4,RECEIPTS

   After the above renaming operation, the file would contain variables% 

             TAX1,B,C,TAX2,TAX3,TAX4,RECEIPTS 

   After a rename operation, any subsequent SPSS statements should refer to 
   variables by their new names.  The old names are no longer recognizable.
   The user can retain the new names permanently by calling for a SAVE FILE 
   at the end of the run. 

   Variables  may  be  renamed  as  often  as  desired  and  at any time -- 
   specifically between statistical procedures.  There is no *RENAME  VARS. 
   Any  new  names assigned will remain in effect until the end of the run,
   or until further renaming of the variables.

   RENAME VARS must be used where duplicate-named variables have been input
   to SPSS by using MERGE FILES (or GET ARCHIVE) with OPTION 3 or OPTION 4.
   For example, a user has two  SPSS  files,  VOT1972  and  VOT1975,  which
   correspond  case  for  case.   They contain, respectively, the following
   variables%

             VOT1972        AGE,SEX,EDUC,OCCUP,INCOME,
                            VAR001,...VAR050
             VOT1975        AGE,SEX,EDUC,OCCUP,INCOME,
                            VAR101...VAR150 

   The  user wants to merge these files and create a single SPSS file which
   contains all the 1972  descriptive  variables  and  vote-responses,  the
   three descriptive variables for 1975 (EDUC, OCCUP, INCOME) and the fifty
   1975 vote-responses.

   The user might specify OPTION 4 with MERGE FILES so that  the  duplicate 
   named variables can be read%

             1              16
             MERGE FILES    FILE=VOT1972,VARIABLES=ALL/ 
                            FILE=VOT1975,VARIABLES=EDUC TO VAR150 
             OPTIONS        4 
  
   When this has been done, SPSS will have 111 active variables. 

   From VOT1972 - SEQNUM(1) , SUBFILE(2) , CASWGT(3) , AGE(4)  ,  SEX(5)  ,
                  EDUC(6) , OCCUP(7) , INCOME(8) , VAR001(9) ... VAR050(58) 

   From VOT1975 - EDUC(59) , OCCUP(60) , INCOME(61) ,
                  VAR101(62) ... VAR150(111)

   Before  any  statistical  processing  can take place, the variables with
   duplicate names must be assigned new names  so  that  each  variable  is 
   uniquely identified.  The user might say%


1 


   Page 67                         SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982


             1              16
             RENAME VARS    EDUC(2),OCCUP(2),INCOME(2)=EDU,OCC,INC

   or 
             1              16
             RENAME VARS    EDUC(2) TO INCOME(2)=EDU,OCC,INC

   A  reference number or subscript of the form (n) entered after a name in
   the variable list designates the nth occurrence of the name  within  the
   current set of variables.  Thus, EDUC(2) above refers to variable number
   59--it would be assigned the new name EDU, and so forth.  When n  is  1,
   it may be omitted.  Thus, 

             1              16
             RENAME VARS    EDUC TO INCOME=EDU,OCC,INC

   would cause the new names to be assigned  to  variables  6,  7,  and  8.
   (This  would  be equally acceptable.)  If the TO convention is used, the 
   name preceding the TO must have  a  reference  number  if  the  intended
   variable  is  not  the  first occurrence of the name.  EDUC TO INCOME(2) 
   designates variables 6 through 61, since EDUC implies EDUC(1). 

   To exchange two variable names P and Q, the user should say% 

             1              16
             RENAME VARS    P,Q=Q,P

   REPORT 

   See Chapter 5 of UPDATE, pages 166-204. 


   The REPORT subprogram does not allocate memory dynamically.   For  large
   problems,  it  may  be necessary to use the SET CM card.  (A preliminary
   EDIT run can be used to find out how much memory will be needed.)

   In SPSS-6000 the default (and maximum) width for alphanumeric  variables 
   in  a  STRING  variable is 8 characters, not 4.  A numeric variable in a 
   STRING will be padded on  the  left  with  blanks,  rather  than  zeros. 
   (UPDATE pages 175-177, Sections 5.22 and 5.25). 

   The  default column-head or title (for both breakvars and columnvars) is
   the  variable  name  rather  than  the  variable  label  (UPDATE,  pages 
   173,178,199).   If  the variable label (the old default) is desired, the 
   keyword (VARLABEL) may be entered among the optional specifications  for 
   a variable in the VARS= or the BREAK= subcommand. 

         EXAMPLES...   BREAK=  EDUC (VARLABEL) (LABEL) (12) 
                       VARS=  INCOME TO RACE (5) (VARLABEL) 




   SPSS-6000 has the following enhancements and new features.

   General

   It  is possible to obtain a report without breaks or summary statistics. 
   Where the user wants, essentially, a customized case-listing, and has no
   need  for  the  BREAK= or SUM= subcommands, they need not be entered.  A
   report with breaks but no SUM= commands is also available.  (However,  a
   report with statistics and no breaks cannot be obtained.) 

   Break  values  (or  value labels), instead of being printed only once at 
   the beginning of a break, are now repeated (together  with  the  message 
   'CONTINUED') at the top of every page, for a multiple-page report.

   The  set  of statistics requested for a given break is not split between
   pages.  That is, if there are not enough lines left on the current  page 
   for  the  entire  set, SPSS-6000 prints the statistics starting on a new 
   page (rather than printing as many as will fit on the current page,  and 
   the rest on the next page).

   The  up-arrow  or hat (^) now functions as an alternate quote character. 
   Up-arrows can be freely used instead of  apostrophes,  in  specifying  a
   page  header  or footer, a column-head or title, a constant element in a
   string variable, or any other text-item.  In particular,  up-arrows  may

   be used where a quote is desired as part of the text.

   LJUST          to have column-headings or titles  left-justified  within
                  the given field-widths.  This is the default. 

   RJUST          to have column-headings right-justified.

   CENTER         to have column-headings centered.   Centered  titles  may 
                  exceed  their  respective column-widths, provided they do
                  not overlap each other.  However,  at  either  end  of  a
                  line,  a  title  which  would otherwise extend beyond the 
                  left  or  right  margin  is   (respectively)   left-   or
                  right-justified with the given margin.

   COLSPACE(n)    allows the user to specify inter-column spacing.  Minimum
                  is 0 (zero).  The default is that the program selects the
                  inter-column spacing (of 1 to 4 spaces).  See UPDATE page 
                  173, Section 5.18.

   BRKSPACE(-1)   is now valid, so that the  first  caselist  line  or  the
                  first  row  of  statistics for a break, can appear on the
                  same print-line as the break head. 

   DOUBLIST       may be used instead of LIST  to  obtain  a  double-spaced
                  case listing.

   TOTAL/NOTOTAL  is a 'global' specification  for  the  given  report  (as
                  before).   It  applies  to all breaks, but it will now be
                  possible  to  override  this  for  selected  breaks  (see 
                  below).  NOTOTAL is the 'global' default.

   LENGTH(t,b)    The default pagesize in SPSS-6000 is not 54 lines.  It is 
                  defined  locally,  and  will thus vary from one computing
                  center to another.  It also depends on print  density  --
                  that is, whether output is formatted for 6 or 8 lines per
                  inch.  The PD= parameter on the SPSS  call  card  can  be
                  used  to  control print density, and the PAGESIZE command 
                  can be used to set the number of  lines  per  page.   See
                  UPDATE page 171, Section 5.11.

   The FORMAT=    subcommand may be omitted entirely.  This  is  equivalent
                  to specifying FORMAT=DEFAULT.

   New or Modified VARS= Specifications 

   VARLABEL       The keyword (VARLABEL) should be included in the variable 
                  specifications,  if  the user wants the variable label to 
                  be used as the column-head or title.
                  (The default title is the variable name.)

   width          A width of 0 may be entered.  Where zero-width  has  been 
                  specified,   the   variable   becomes   a  'non-printing'
                  variable; it will not be assigned any  print  columns  on 
                  the  page   (nor any intercolumn spaces).  This is useful
                  where simple statistics on a variable are needed as terms 
                  for  a  composite function, but there is no need to print 
                  the simple statistics  (or the case contents if LIST  has
                  been  specified)  for  the variable.  The default varlist
                  for a summary group does not include non-printing vars.



   New or Modified BREAK= Keywords

   VARLABEL       A break  variable  definition  may  include  the  keyword
                  (VARLABEL),  to indicate that the variable label is to be 
                  used as a column-heading or title. 

   TOTAL/NOTOTAL  may be specified for any given break.  The default to  be
                  applied to each break is the global TOTAL/NOTOTAL. 

   Multiple       keywords  in  a  BREAK=  subcommand  may  be   separately
                  parenthesized, or grouped together. 

                       (LABEL) (VARLABEL) (TITLE) (TOTAL) (SKIP(4)) 
                                 is equivalent to 
                       (LABEL VARLABEL TITLE TOTAL SKIP(4)) 

   The BREAK=     subcommand may be omitted entirely.  No SUM=  subcommands 
                  are  allowed  in  this case, and LIST or DOUBLIST must be
                  specified in the FORMAT= subcommand.



   New or Modified SUM= Keywords

   SEMEAN    Standard error of the mean is a new simple statistic  (UPDATE, 
             page 181). 

   MULTIPLY  is a composite function to compute the product of (any  number 
             of) terms.

   SQRT      Square root is a new composite function.  It may have only one
             term.

   Page 71                         SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982


             SEMEAN,  MULTIPLY, and SQRT all have a default print format of
             (column width - 1). 

   SUBTRACT  The number of terms for the composite  function  SUBTRACT  was
             formerly limited to two.  It may now have any number of terms.
             It is evaluated as .. (TERM1 - TERM2 - TERM3 ... - TERMn) 

   VALIDN    may be obtained for  alphanumeric  SPSSvars.   (They  must  of
             course  be named in the VARS= subcommand).  VALIDN must be the
             only statistic requested if alpha vars are explicitly named in
             the varlist for a given summary group.

             Alpha  vars  will  be automatically selected as members of the
             default varlist, if VALIDN is the only statistic requested for 
             a given summary group.  Otherwise, they will not be included. 


   Composite functions have been extended.  PCTGT, PCTLT, PCTBTN, MODE, and 
             MEDIAN  are  now  valid  terms  for  a composite function (see 
             UPDATE, pages 181-182).  The usual arguments, as well  as  the 
             variable to be used, must be specified. 

        EXAMPLES% 

             MULTIPLY (PCTGT(4)(VAR1)  VALIDN (VAR1)) 'IN FAVOR' (VAR1(2))
             SUBTRACT (MEDIAN (20,40)(AGE),   20.)    (COHORT1) 
             AVERAGE  (MODE(0,12) (VARX)
                       MODE(0,12) (VARY)
                       MODE(0,12) (VARZ)) (DUM1(0)) 


   RMISS(arg)
             permits  the  user  to  specify  how a missing result is to be 
             reported.   By  default,  the  letter  M  is  printed  in  the
             appropriate column when a statistic cannot be computed because 
             of missing data or division by 0, but the user may now  supply
             a value or legend to be used instead. 

             The argument for RMISS can be a numeric value such as 
                      3.1416     0      -999

             or it can be a quoted legend such as 
                   'NONE'       '-----'      'X'     'NAV'. 

             RMISS ('') can be used to have nothing printed. 

             If  the  argument  is a value, it will be reported in the same
             format as the unavailable statistic  --  the  same  number  of 
             decimal  places, an asterisk if the field-width is too narrow,
             etc.  If the argument is a legend, it  will  be  truncated  if
             necessary,    and   otherwise   right-justified   within   the 
             field-width.

   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 72


             RMISS  if  used  must  be the first specification of a summary
             group -- it must precede the statistics list -- and it applies
             to  all the statistics for that summary group only.  Different
             groups may have different RMISS arguments.  The default M will 
             be used for any group without an RMISS specification. 

             RMISS is the one optional specification to the SUM= subcommand 
             that must precede the statistics list.  Since RMISS  specifies
             the  missing  value  for  the following summary group, it will 
             also terminate a preceding summary group even if there are  no
             optional specifications for that group.

                  EXAMPLE%
                       MEAN VALIDN RMISS (-1) VARIANCE (EDUC) 

             MEAN and VALIDN are the first summary group, and all  defaults 
             (the  default  varlist and so forth) will apply.  VARIANCE for
             EDUC is requested in the second summary group,  to  which  the 
             RMISS(-1) applies.


   CON       may now be used as a short form for the keyword CONTINUE. 

   CONCON    means  'continue  [the  keyword]  CONTINUE'.   Where   several 
             successive  summary groups need the CONTINUE specification, it
             would normally have to be entered separately for  each.   User 
             may  now  enter  CONCON instead of CONTINUE for the first such
             group, and omit CONTINUE for the others. 

   NEW       must be used with the first summary group which is to start on 
             a  new  line  after  CONCON  has  been  specified.  NEW is not 
             otherwise required for a new-line group -- e.g.  if  preceding 
             groups had separate CONTINUE keywords -- but does no harm. 

             Keywords  NEW,  CONCON  and  CONTINUE  may be placed after the
             statistics list, or they may appear  before  it  if  they  are 
             adequately  separated  from  the  previous  group as explained 
             below.  RMISS if used must precede any of these keywords.

             NEW and CONCON (unlike RMISS) do not by themselves cause a new
             group to be initiated. 

                  EXAMPLE%
                       MEAN VALIDN NEW VARIANCE (EDUC)

             This is a single summary group,  requesting  three  statistics
             for  variable  EDUC.  If two separate groups are desired, they
             must be  separated  by  something  other  than  NEW  --  e.g.,
             optional  specifications for the first group, or RMISS for the 
             second.

   SUM=      may be omitted.  Where a SUM= subcommand is not supplied for a 
             given  break,  the  default  is  to  use  the most recent SUM= 
             specifications (supplied with some previous break).   If  none 
             exist  (no  SUM=  specifications  have  been entered thus far)
             there are no statistics to be done for the current break.

                        EXAMPLE%
                             BREAK 1
                             BREAK 2
                             BREAK 3
                             SUM = MEAN VALIDN
                             BREAK 4
                             BREAK 5
                             BREAK 6
                             SUM = KURTOSIS 
                             BREAK 7

             The  first two breaks have no statistics, MEAN and VALIDN will
             be computed and reported for the next three, and KURTOSIS will
             be done for the last two breaks.


   Errors

   The text of the numbered  error  messages  (see  UPDATE,  page  201)  is
   identical  or  similar  in SPSS-6000, but the numbers are different, and 
   some have been added.  The diagnostic set of 'immediate' error  messages 
   (see UPDATE, page 202) has been considerably expanded and improved. 


   How to Have Missing Values Print as Blanks in your Case-listing.

   To suppress the printing of particular data values (probably though  not
   necessarily missing values) in a case-listing, do the following% 

       1.   Define  null  value  labels  for  the  values in question.  For 
            example% 

                  1              16 
                  VALUE LABELS   V1 TO V3 (0) (99) /

       2.   Specify  (LABEL)  in  the VARS= subcommand for the variables in 
            question.  When this option is in effect, a value label (if one
            has been defined for a given value) will be used, otherwise the 
            observed value is printed.

   (This is not  unique  to  SPSS-6000,  and  is  included  here  only  for 
   emphasis.)

   REPORT.

   See Data Checking with REPORT.  and STOP.  on page 13 of this document. 


   RUN SUBFILES 
  
   The  inclusive  TO convention may be used in naming lists of subfiles on
   the RUN SUBFILES cards (SPSS, page 68).


   SAVE ARCHIVE 

   The SAVE ARCHIVE card can have  the  keyword  COMPRESSED  as  the  first
   specification to cause a compressed system file to be written.  See page 
   7 of this document for details.

   The following restrictions on SAVE ARCHIVE do  not  apply  to  SPSS-6000
   (SPSS, pages 170,174).


   1.  The order in which variables are saved on the  output  archive  file
       depends  on  the  order  in  which  the  files are named on the SAVE
       ARCHIVE card, not the order in which the files are named on the  GET
       ARCHIVE card.

   2.  DELETE VARS and KEEP VARS can be used to delete/keep existing active 
       variables on the file created by SAVE ARCHIVE.

   3.  Any number of value labels can be saved on an  output  archive  file 
       for any active or latent variable. 


   SAVE FILE

   When  SAVE  FILE  is the only procedure in the run and a large number of 
   cases are being processed, it is often desirable to inhibit the  writing
   of  the  scratch  file.   This can be done by specifying X=0 on the SPSS
   call card (see the X= parameter on page 88 of this document).  This  can
   only  be  used, however, when the size of the file (the number of cases)
   is known in advance of reading the cases.  Therefore X=0 cannot be  used
   when  N  OF CASES is UNKNOWN, or when case selection (SAMPLE, SELECT IF,
   etc.)  is requested.  X=0 is also illegal when ADD CASES or ADD SUBFILES
   are used in a run.

   The  SAVE  FILE  card  can  have  the  keyword  COMPRESSED  as the first
   specification to cause a compressed system file to be written.  See page 
   7 of this document.

   SAVE  FILE  may  appear  anywhere  in  the  job  deck;  it  need  not be

   SAVE SCSS

   See page 27 of this document.


   SCATTERGRAM

   The following additional OPTIONs are available (SPSS, page 296). 

   OPTION  9.     Rounded Scaling  is  used  for  plot  labels.   'Rounded'
                  scaling  attempts  to  find  rounded values for the scale
                  values printed at the tick marks.

   OPTION 10.     Output is formatted for 80 columns.  This is the  default
                  in abbreviated batch or online format.

   In Version 8.3 OPTION 8 was changed.  It calls for random sampling where
   there are too many cases to fit in memory.  The algorithm used to sample 
   cases  is the same as that used for NONPAR CORR, OPTION 7.  (See UPDATE,
   page 315, Section 19.30 for  an  explanation  of  this  algorithm.)   If 
   OPTION  8  is not requested, and there is not enough memory to store the
   cases, then the plots will not be produced.  However, an attempt is made
   to produce the plots for the next subfile group(s), if any.  Running out 
   ot memory will no longer result in an aborted run. 


   A  'BY control' specification has been added.  This provides for the use 
   of a plotting symbol defined by the values of the control variable.  The
   BY  specification  follows  the list of variables to be plotted.  If the
   control  variable  is  an  alphanumeric  variable,  then  the  left-most 
   non-blank  character  of  the value is used.  If the control variable is 
   numeric, then the left-most digit of the absolute value of the number is 
   used.   A  range  is allowed for a numeric 'BY' variable, but is ignored
   for an alphanumeric 'BY' variable.

   EXAMPLES%

         1.   Variable SEX has values of 'M' for male and 'F'  for  female.
              A  plot  of Height vs.  Weight, with plotting symbols defined 
              by SEX, can be obtained as follows% 

              1             16
              SCATTERGRAM   HEIGHT WEIGHT BY SEX/ 

         2.   Variable  GROUP  takes  on  values  from  1  to  5.  Plots of 
              variables A,B, and C against variable AGE with  the  plotting 
              symbols  defined  by  the  values of GROUP can be obtained as 
              follows%

         3.   If  the  above plots are to include only subjects in groups 2 
              through 4, then use the following%

   Note that%

              1             16
              SCATTERGRAM   A BY GROUP/ 

   is not valid, since there must be at least two variables to plot  (GROUP
   only provides plotting symbols).
  

   Scratch File Names

   SPSS  uses  scratch files for copies of the data, variable labels, value
   labels and transformation vectors.  Prior to Version  8.3,  these  files 
   were named% 
             XXSPS1, XXSPS2, ..., XXSPS6. 
   In Version 8.3 the names were changed to be% 
             ZZSPS1, ZZSPS2,  ...,  ZZSPS6,  making  them  consistent  with 
   system scratch file naming conventions.

   Most  people will be unaffected by this change because the scratch files
   are normally used only by SPSS.  However, some people made  use  of  the
   fact  that  SPSS  writes a binary copy of the data on the file (formerly
   named) XXSPS2, and  they  assigned  this  file  to  magnetic  tape  (for
   purposes of reducing the mass storage requirements, or using the file as 
   input to subsequent SPSS runs).  Users who wish to do this  should  make 
   sure  that  their tape control cards (REQUEST or LABEL) refer to the new 
   name ZZSPS2, rather than the old XXSPS2.

   See UPDATE, page 276, Section 11.6.
   The following additional formats for the SEED command are available.

             1              16
             SEED           STANDARD
             SEED           'an alphabetic string'

   These both provide for reproducing a set of random numbers.  The keyword
   STANDARD causes a constant with known random  number  properties  to  be 
   used  as  the  starting  seed.  Alternately, an alphabetic string can be 
   specified as the seed as in%

   Page 77                         SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982


             1              16
             SEED           '12.31.45'

   An alphabetic seed must be enclosed in single quotes ('). 

   The  capability  to specify an alphabetic seed was implemented so that a 
   run which  used  the  system-supplied  seed  could  be  replicated.   By
   default,  the initial seed in SPSS-6000 is a function of the time of day 
   that the job begins.  This is printed as part of the header of each page
   of  output.  The second example above shows how the time of day from the
   header of one run may be used as the starting seed for another run. 

   The additional random number function POISSON is available (see  UPDATE, 
   page 277). 


   SELECT IF

   SELECT IF  and *SELECT IF commands are executed in sequence (see UPDATE,
   page 276).  If the logical condition specified on a SELECT IF  statement
   is  evaluated  as  false, the selection requirement has not been met and
   the  case  is  'deselected'  (that  is,  dropped)  at  once;  additional 
   transformations   if   any  are  not  processed.   Where  the  selection
   requirement is satisfied and the case is retained, the program continues
   to process transformation control cards, if any follow.

   Thus  where  multiple  SELECT IFs are used, the case must satisfy all of
   the conditions specified; if it fails on any one of them it  is  dropped 
   at  that  point.   The case could also be 'deselected' or dropped at any 
   point due to SAMPLE or REJECT IF,  where  these  commands  are  used  in
   combination with SELECT IF. 

   See  Order  of  Evaluation of Data Selection Commands on page 59 of this
   document.

   MISSING VALUE  indicators  are  ignored  in   evaluating   the   logical 
   expression on the SELECT IF card. 


   SET CM 

   The  SET CM control card can be used to increase the field length beyond 
   that allocated by default for  the  execution  of  the  subsequent  SPSS 
   procedure.  The format of this card is% 

             1              16
             SET CM         field length in octal 

   SPSS-6000 will increase the field length to that requested,  or  to  the 
   MAXIMUM  FIELD  LENGTH  in effect for the run, whichever is smaller (see 
   Memory Requirements, page 53 of this document).



1 


   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 78


   Note that the  SET CM  card  is  rarely  needed,  as  SPSS-6000  usually
   allocates  sufficient  CM for the requested procedure.  DISCRIMINANT and 
   REPORT will terminate with an appropriate error message in scanning  the
   control  card  if  additional  CM  is  needed.   MULT RESPONSE allocates 
   approximately the CM it needs for tables and uses whatever space is left 
   over  for  VALUE  LABELS.   If  there  is insufficient space for all the
   category labels for a given table, some are simply left off the  output.
   In all three cases, SET CM can be used to request a larger field length. 
   The SET CM card should immediately precede the procedure card  to  which
   it applies. 


   SORT CASES 

   See Chapter 14, pages 289-291, of UPDATE. 

   In SPSS-6000 up to 99 variables may be used as sort keys. 


   STATISTICS 

   The  inclusive  TO  convention  may  be  used  in  a  number list on the 
   STATISTICS card (SPSS, page 66). 

  
   STOP.

   See Data Checking with REPORT.  and STOP.  on page 13 of this document. 


   Subfile Names

   Subfile names may be up  to  8  characters  long,  and  the  first  four
   characters need not be unique (SPSS, page 39).


   SUMMARY TABLES 

   In  online  format  (see page 83 of this document) the grid lines in the
   summary tables are by default suppressed, and OPTION 8 causes them to be 
   printed.


   SURVIVAL 

   See UPDATE, Chapter 6, pages 205-219. 

   The following additional OPTION is available.

   OPTION 10.     requests that the output (including plots) be printed  in 
                  a   narrow  format  suitable  for  listing  at  80-column
                  terminals.  This output format is automatically  selected

   Page 79                         SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982


                  for SPSS/ONLINE. 

   Note  that  the YRMODA function (see UPDATE Section 11.9, pages 277-278) 
   should now be used in preference to the JULIAN  function,  although  the
   JULIAN function remains available. 

   In abbreviated batch or online format (see page 83 of this document) the
   NUMBER EXPOSED TO RISK, and  PROPN  TERMINATING  are  not  part  of  the 
   survival table. 


   T-TEST 

   If  no  variable  pair with different variables can be obtained from the
   variable list of a PAIRS= specification, the list is skipped.

   The following additional OPTIONs are available (SPSS, page 273). 

   OPTION 4.      Invokes special handling for paired  variable  tests.   A
                  special  set  of conventions applies to the specification 
                  of variable lists for paired variable tests, which  makes
                  it  convenient  for  specifying  most  testing situations 
                  involving large numbers of variables.  The format of  the
                  variable  list  is essentially like the variable list for
                  the PEARSON CORR routine.  In other words, the  list  may
                  be of the form 

                  V(1),V(2)...V(k) WITH V(k+1),V(k+2) |...V(k+p)
  
                  The  TO  convention  may  be  used  to  name  consecutive 
                  variables.   OPTION  4  determines  how   the   list   is
                  interpreted. 

                  With OPTION 4 selected, a list of the form 

                  V(1),V(2)...V(k) 

                  will  be tested sequentially -- V(1) with V(2), V(2) with 
                  V(3), V(k-1) with V(k) for a total of k-1 tests.  A  list
                  of the form

                  V(1),V(2)...V(k) WITH V(k+1),V(k+2) |...V(k+p)

                  will  be  handled pairwise -- V(1) with V(k+1), V(2) with 
                  V(k+2), V(k) with V(k+k).  In this case, there should  be 
                  an  equal  number  of  variables on each side of the WITH
                  (e.g., k must equal p).

                  The PEARSON CORR interpretation is in effect when  OPTION 
                  4  has  not  been  selected.   Namely,  V(1),...V(k) will 
                  generate   k*(k-1)/2   tests   between    all    possible
                  combinations  --  V(1)...V(k)  WITH  V(k+1)...V(k+p) will 


1 


   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 80


                  generate k*p tests between all combinations of a variable 
                  from  the  left  hand  list  with one from the right hand 
                  list. 

   OPTION 5.      Causes Hotelling's T**2 statistic for the equality of two 
                  vectors  of  means  to  be  computed and printed.  In the 
                  independent samples case,  multiple  variable  lists  can 
                  follow   the   VARIABLES=   specification,  separated  by
                  slashes.   A  T**2  test  is  performed  for  each  list.
                  Similarly,  for paired variable tests, a separate test is
                  performed  for  each  set  of  variables  (separated   by
                  slashes)  following the PAIRS= specification.  The use of
                  OPTION 5 forces listwise deletion  of  missing  data  and 
                  implies  that  OPTION  4  is  also  to be used for paired 
                  T-tests. 

                  For example, the T-TEST control card%

                  1         16
                  T-TEST    GROUPS=A(1,2)/
                            VARIABLES=A,B,C/D,E,F,G/
                            PAIRS=K,L,M WITH N,O,P/Q,R,S,T
                  OPTIONS   5 

                  will generate the normal printed output for  the  t-tests 
                  for  variables A, B, and C.  This will be followed by the
                  T**2 test for A, B, and C.  This is one T**2  test  using
                  all  three  variables  - the vector of means are compared 
                  between the two groups - (A mean of group 1,  B  mean  of 
                  group 1, C mean of group 1 ) versus (A mean of group 2, B
                  mean of group 2, C mean of group 2).  T-test  output  for
                  variables  D,  E,  F,  and G will be followed by the T**2
                  test output for D, E, F, and  G.   The  output  from  the
                  paired variable tests (K with N, L with O, M with P) will
                  be followed by the T**2 test of K mean, L  mean,  M  mean
                  versus  N  mean,  O  mean, P mean.  This is one T**2 test 
                  comparing the two sets of means (K,L,M)  versus  (N,O,P). 
                  The  output  from the second set of paired variable tests
                  (Q with R, R with S, and S with T) will  be  followed  by
                  the  T**2 test of Q mean, R mean, S mean versus R mean, S
                  mean, T mean. 


   VALUE LABELS 

   The VALUE LABELS card can  appear  in  the  job  deck  after  the  first 
   statistical procedure card.  This makes it possible to assign new labels
   to *RECODEd variables.  Value labels can only be redefined once per  job 
   for a given variable (SPSS, pages 61, 63). 

   The  keyword  ALL  may  be used on the VALUE LABELS card to assign value 
   labels to all of the variables in the file.

   WEIGHT 

   If WEIGHT or *WEIGHT is used, the automatic variable CASWGT  should  not 
   be  used  in  data-transformation or data-selection statements.  This is 
   because CASWGT is not assigned the value of the weighting variable until
   all  transformations  of  a  type  (permanent  or  temporary)  have been
   performed.   The  weighting  variable  itself  can  always  be  used  in
   data-transformations and data-selection statements. 

   Incorrect Example

             1              16
             VARIABLE LIST  X,Y,WGTVAR
             .
             .
             SELECT IF      (CASWGT GT 1.0) 
             WEIGHT         WGTVAR
             .
             .
             FINISH 

   Correct Example

             1              16
             VARIABLE LIST  X,Y,WGTVAR

             .
             FINISH 


  

   WRITE CASES

   The  following  additional  OPTIONs are available for WRITE CASES (SPSS,
   page 143). 

   OPTION 2.      Allows  a  discrepancy  between  the  number  of   format
                  specifications  and  the number of variables named on the
                  WRITE CASES card.  With OPTION 2 selected, the  following
                  would be legal% 

                  WRITE CASES    (8F10.2) VAR001 TO VAR085

   OPTION 3.      Do not integerize the  output  data.   That  is,  decimal
                  points  are not suppressed, but are written on the output 


1 


   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 82


                  file.  This is especially useful if WRITE CASES output is
                  to be printed and visually examined.

   OPTION 4.      Write the BINARY file without end-of-records.   That  is,
                  OPTION 4 used in conjunction with WRITE CASES BINARY will
                  cause the system to write a blocked file.  This can  save
                  tape or disk space and, thus, processing time.  This form
                  of blocked file does not  contain  any  system  generated
                  record  counts;  it  is not compatible with standard FTN4
                  and FTN5 binary files, for instance.  This  form  can  be
                  read  by  SPSS,  however,  with  the  INPUT FORMAT BINARY 
                  specification. 

   OPTION 5.      Write an end-of-file following the  data  on  the  output 
                  file. 


   When BINARY is specified instead of  a  format,  the  output  file  from
   WRITE CASES  contains  no  special  flag  words, control words or record 
   counts (e.g., CRM format  BT=C,  RT=S).   To  read  a  file  created  by
   WRITE CASES  BINARY  in  a  FORTRAN  program,  the following sequence of 
   control cards should be used.

             .
             .
             .
             REWIND,lfn. 
             FTN. 
             FILE,lfn,BT=C,RT=S. 
             LDSET,FILES=lfn.
             LGO. 
             .
             .

   To  read  a  binary  output file from WRITE CASES in SPSS, use the INPUT 
   FORMAT BINARY specification.

   Batch, Abbreviated Batch, and Online Output 

   Three types of output  are  available  in  SPSS-6000  -  standard  batch 
   output,  abbreviated  batch  output,  and online output.  Standard batch
   output is 134-column output with page  headings  and  carriage  control. 
   Abbreviated  batch  output  is  similar to standard batch output, except
   that the page  width  is  limited  to  80  columns.   Online  output  is
   80-column output without page headings or carriage control.  When online
   format is selected, the SPSS control cards are  not  echoed  back.   The
   default output is standard batch format, and abbreviated batch or online
   format can be selected with the LO parameter on the SPSS call card  (see
   page 85 of this document). 

   When  abbreviated batch output is selected, only the first 40 characters
   of the RUN NAME and the first  36  characters  of  the  file  label  are
   printed.   In addition, the meaning of a few OPTIONs varies depending on 
   the type of output, and some OPTIONs and STATISTICs are  only  available
   with  standard  batch output.  The following is a list of differences by 
   procedure.


   AGGREGATE
   SKEW,  KURT,  PCTGT,  PCTLT,  and  PCTBTN  are  not  printed  as part of 
   STATISTIC 2 or 3 in abbreviated batch or online format.


   BREAKDOWN
   The sum and variance for each group are not printed in abbreviated batch
   and online format.  Grid lines in the CROSSBREAK table are suppressed in 
   online format. 


   CONDESCRIPTIVE 
   OPTION 4 (print reference dictionary) is not available in online format. 


   CROSSTABS
   OPTION  9 (print index of tables) is not available in online format.  By
   default, grid lines are suppressed  in  online  format,  and  OPTION  14 
   causes them to be printed.


   DISCRIMINANT 
   By default, the step-by-step output is suppressed in online format,  and 
   OPTION 3 causes the step-by-step output to be printed.  OPTIONs 7 (print 
   a single plot of cases), 8 (print a separate plot for each  group),  and
   10  (print  territorial  map) are not available in online or abbreviated
   batch format. 




1 


   SPSS-6000 8.3 UPDATE MANUAL - MARCH 1982                         Page 84




   FACTOR 
   STATISTIC  8 (plot of the rotated factors) is not available in online or
   abbreviated batch format.


   FREQUENCIES
   OPTION  9  (print  index  of  tables) is ignored in online format unless
   OPTION 4 (write tables on BCDOUT) is also requested. 


   JFACTOR
   STATISTIC  8 (plot of the rotated factors) is not available in online or
   abbreviated batch format.


   MANOVA 
   The  95 percent confidence interval for the group mean is not printed as 
   part of PRINT = CELLINFO(MEANS) in online or abbreviated batch format. 


   REGRESSION 
   By  default, the step-by-step output and the summary table is suppressed
   under online format and the meaning of OPTIONs  6  and  7  is  reversed. 
   OPTION  6  causes  the  step-by-step results to be printed, and OPTION 7 
   causes the summary table to be printed.  Information about the variables
   which  are  not in the equation is not printed in online and abbreviated 
   batch format. 


   RELIABILITY
   The  squared  multiple correlation is not printed as part of STATISTIC 9 
   in abbreviated batch or online format. 


   SUMMARY TABLES 
   By  default,  the  grid  lines  in  the summary tables are suppressed in
   online format, and OPTION 8 causes them to be printed. 


   SURVIVAL 
   The  NUMBER  EXPOSED  TO RISK, and PROPN TERMINATING are not part of the 
   survival table in online and abbreviated batch format.

   SPSS Call Statement 

   The description replaces Section  F.1.2.1  in  the  SPSS  manual  (pages
   605-606).   The  following  control  card  causes the SPSS program to be 
   loaded and executed%

             SPSS (p1,p2,...pn) 

   The optional parameters 'pi' specify operational modes and files  to  be
   used  and  can  be  given in any order within parentheses.  Generally, a
   parameter can be omitted or included in one of the following forms% 

             pi = lfn

             pi = value

   where 'pi' is one of the parameter indicators given below and 'lfn' is a
   1-7  alphanumeric  file  name.   SPSS accepts only one occurrence of any
   parameter.


   Optional Parameters
   Option         Description

   A=lfn          Alternate BCD  output  is  to  be  written  on  file  lfn
                  (matrices, residuals, Z scores, etc.).

   A omitted      Alternate BCD output is written on BCDOUT.

   BL=kkk         Input data file is  an  L  tape  containing  fixed-length 
                  records  (see  RL)  with  blocks of maximum size kkk.  RL 
                  must be specified for both S and L  tapes.   BL  must  be 
                  specified  for  L  tapes but is optional for S tapes (kkk
                  less than 5120).  See INPUT FORMAT on  page  40  of  this 
                  document. 

   BL omitted     Input data is not an L tape.

   D=lfn          SPSS input data are to be read from file lfn.   Parameter 
                  overrides the INPUT MEDIUM card if present.

   D omitted      Data are to be read from the SPSS statement  file  (INPUT
                  or the file defined with the I= parameter). 

   ER=nnnn        Maximum  number  of   allowable   I/O   errors   (illegal 
                  characters in 'F' format fields) is nnnn. 

   ER omitted     Maximum number of allowable I/O errors is 100.

   G=lfn          SPSS system file will be read from lfn, i.e., due to  GET
                  FILE. 

   G omitted      SPSS system file will be read from GTFILE. 

   G1=lfn         Input ARCHIVE file 1 is lfn.

   G1 omitted     Input ARCHIVE file 1 is GTARC1.

   G2 = lfn       Input ARCHIVE file 2 is lfn.

   G2 omitted     Input ARCHIVE file 2 is GTARC2.

   G3=lfn         Input ARCHIVE file 3 is lfn.

   G3 omitted     Input ARCHIVE file 3 is GTARC3.

   G4=lfn         Input ARCHIVE file 4 is lfn.

   G4 omitted     Input ARCHIVE file 4 is GTARC4.

   G5=lfn         Input ARCHIVE file 5 is lfn.

   G5 omitted     Input ARCHIVE file 5 is GTARC5.

   I=lfn          SPSS statements comprise the next record on file lfn.

   I omitted      Statements are on file INPUT.

   L=lfn          SPSS printed output is to be written on file lfn. 

   L omitted      Printed output is written on OUTPUT.

   LO=ABRV        Specifies that abbreviated batch output format is  to  be 
                  used  (e.g.,  80  character page width with page headings 
                  and carriage control).

   LO=ONLINE      Specifies that online output format is  to  be  used  (80 
                  character  page  width  with no page headings or carriage 
                  control).

   LO omitted     Specifies that standard batch output format is to be used 
                  (134 character page width with page headings and carriage
                  control).

   M=lfn          Matrix or matrices are to be read from  file  lfn.   This
                  parameter overrides the INPUT MEDIUM card if present. 

   M omitted      Matrix or matrices are to be read from the SPSS statement
                  file (INPUT or the file defined with the I= parameter).

   MF=value       Specifies the maximum field length that SPSS will attempt
                  to  use  (see  Memory  Requirements,  on  page 53 of this 
                  document).

   MF omitted     The maximum field length that SPSS will attempt to use is
                  the  maximum  available to the SPSS job step.  Procedures 
                  which need more than this will be aborted.

   NR             Data input files (either D= or G=) are  not  returned  or
                  unloaded  by SPSS.  They remain accessible in the job for 
                  later use.

   NR, U omitted  Data input files are returned after the  data  have  been
                  read. 

                  For  disk  storage  files, there is no difference between 
                  'return' and 'unload' - local files are removed from  the 
                  job  and the disk space is released.  Permanent files are 
                  made available to other jobs.  For tape  files,  'return'
                  releases  the  magnetic  tape  reservation -- the maximum 
                  number of magnetic tapes that can be used by the  job  is 
                  reduced by one.  The U option for tape input files allows
                  the  tape  to  be  released,  without  losing  the  drive 
                  reservation,  so that another tape may be requested later
                  in the job. 

   OS=lfn         File  lfn  contains  an  OSIRIS  dictionary  for  use  in
                  conjunction  with  the  OSIRIS VARS card.  (A binary tape 
                  file or  disk  file  may  be  used.)   RL  must  also  be
                  specified. 

   OS omitted     The OSIRIS VARS feature is not being used.

   PD=6 or 8      Specifies whether the printed output is to  be  formatted 
                  for 6 or 8 lines per inch printing.

   PD omitted     Specifies that the printed output is to be formatted  for
                  8 lines per inch printing.

   RL=nnn         The record size of the  input  data  file  is  nnn.   The 
                  record  size nnn must include any end-of-line bytes.  See
                  INPUT FORMAT on page 40 of this document for non-standard 
                  and large records. 

   RL omitted     Input data are on a standard coded file (CRM format BT=C, 
                  RT=Z).   The  maximum  record  size is 148 characters (RL
                  defaults to 150). 

   S=lfn          SPSS system file will be written on file lfn,  i.e.,  due 
                  to SAVE FILE or SAVE ARCHIVE.

   S omitted      SPSS system file will be written on SVFILE. 

   U              Data input files are unloaded after  the  data  has  been
                  read. 

   X=lfn          File lfn will be used to store the input data  in  binary 
                  form for second and subsequent procedure calls. 

   X=0            The binary copy of the data will not  be  written.   This 
                  option  can  save  computer time and disk space when only
                  one procedure is to be executed, particularly if there is
                  a  large number of cases.  The writing of the binary file
                  is often automatically inhibited when there is  only  one
                  procedure.   X=0  is  primarily  useful  in the following 
                  situations% 

                    a)  Raw data are included in the SPSS statement file. 
                    b)  SAVE FILE is requested. 

                  X=0   is   disallowed   under   any   of   the  following 
                  circumstances% 

                  Two or more procedures are requested. 
                  Data are read in by GET SCSS, GET ARCHIVE,or MERGE FILES. 
                  Subfiles are to  be  processed  other  than  sequentially 
                       (due to a RUN SUBFILES command).
                  SAVE ARCHIVE or SAVE SCSS is requested.
                  SAVE  FILE  is  requested  in  combination  with  certain
                       other commands (see  SAVE  FILE,  page  74  of  this 
                       document, for details).

   X omitted      File ZZSPS2 will be used to store  the  binary  data  for
                  second and subsequent procedures.

                  If  only one procedure is requested SPSS-6000 does not as
                  a rule write the  binary  scratch  file.   Sometimes  the
                  binary  file cannot be suppressed (see limitations on X=0 
                  above); circumstances under which the scratch file can be
                  suppressed,  where  this  is  not done automatically, are 
                  also described above.
