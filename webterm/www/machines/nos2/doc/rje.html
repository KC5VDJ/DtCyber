The Cyber 865 and 175 at the Nostalgic Computing Center each run two subsystems named RBF and TLF. RBF is the Remote Batch Facility.
It accepts batch jobs from remote batch stations, and it arranges for the output from these batch jobs to be returned to the originating
remote batch stations.
      </p>
      <p>
TLF is the TieLine Facility. It enables the Cyber 865 and 175 to act as remote batch stations, allowing users of the Cyber systems to
submit batch jobs to other computer systems. TLF also arranges for the output from these jobs to be returned to the originating
Cyber mainframe.
      </p>
The Cyber 865 has two physical HASP connections to Prime1 (one of the Prime P9950 systems). One of these connections is managed by TLF, and
the other is managed by RBF. Thus, users of the 865 can send batch jobs to the P9950, and users of the P9950 can send batch jobs to
the 865. The Cyber 865 also has one physical HASP connection to the IBM 3033 (running the MVS operating system), and this connection is
managed by TLF. This allows users of the 865 to submit batch jobs to the 3033. Similarly, the Cyber 175 has two physical HASP connections
to Prime2 (the second Prime P9950 system) and two physical HASP connections to the IBM 4381 (running the VM/CMS operating system), and
these two pairs of connections enable bi-directional job exchange between the 175 and P9950, and the 175 and IBM 4381.
      </p>
      <p>
To submit a batch job to a system supported by TLF from either of the Cyber systems, a user specifies the target system's
3-character LID (logical identifier) on the job card (first line) of the file to be submitted. TLF reads the job card to determine
where to route the job (as indicated by the LID) and what the user has named the job. The job card is not sent to the target system.
The second and subsequent lines of the file are sent to the target system. They represent commands in the target system's job command
language. 
      </p>
      <p>
For example, a job file destined for the IBM 4381 might look like:
      </p>
      <pre>
/JOB
/NOSEQ
/EC=$
MYJOB,ST=CMS.
ID       CMSBATCH

To submit this job to the IBM 4381 and cause the output to be returned to your wait queue, execute the SUBMIT command as in:
      </p>
      <pre>
    SUBMIT,<i>lfn</i>,TO.</pre>
      <p>
Where <i>lfn</i> is the name of the local file containing the job. If you specify BC instead of
TO on the SUBMIT command, the job's output will be sent to the NOS print queue, and you can visit
the <a href="http://www.nostalgiccomputing.org:8081" target="ncc-output-folders">Nostalgic Computing Center Output Folders</a> page
to find it.
      </p>
      <p>
Each machine to which TLF can send jobs is identified by a unique LID (Logical IDentifier). To route a job to a particular
machine, its LID is specified on the job's jobcard, as described above. The following table lists the machines at the
Nostalgic Computing Center to which TLF can send jobs:
