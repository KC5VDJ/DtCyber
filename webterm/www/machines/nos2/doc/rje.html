The NOS 2.8.7 system supports two subsystems named RBF and TLF. RBF is the Remote Batch Facility. It accepts batch jobs from remote batch
stations, and it arranges for the output from these batch jobs to be returned to the originating remote batch stations.
      </p>
      <p>
TLF is the TieLine Facility. It enables NOS 2.8.7 to act as remote batch stations, allowing its users to submit batch jobs to other computer
systems. TLF also arranges for the output from these jobs to be returned to the originating NOS 2.8.7 system.
      </p>
      <p>
When both RBF and TLF are installed and running on a NOS 2.8.7 system, it can receive batch jobs from remote batch stations, and it can also
act as a remote batch station and batch jobs to other remote batch hosts. The data communication protocol used by both RBF and TLF to exchange
jobs and output files is named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Automatic_Spooling_Priority" target="_blank">HASP</a>.
HASP was implemented originally for IBM mainframes, but most other computer system vendors including Control Data eventually implemented as
well, so it became a de facto industry standard for providing remote job entry.
      </p>
      <p>
To submit a batch job to a system supported by TLF, a user specifies the target system's 3-character LID (logical identifier) on the job card
(first line) of the file to be submitted. TLF reads the job card to determine where to route the job (as indicated by the LID) and what the
user has named the job. The job card is not sent to the target system. The second and subsequent lines of the file are sent to the target system.
They represent commands in the target system's job command language. 
      </p>
      <p>
For example, a job file destined for the IBM 4381 might look like:
      </p>
      <pre>
/JOB
/NOSEQ
/EC=$
MYJOB,ST=CMS.

To submit this job to the IBM 4381 and cause the output to be returned to your wait queue, execute the SUBMIT command as in:
      </p>
      <pre>
    SUBMIT,<i>lfn</i>,TO.</pre>
      <p>
Where <i>lfn</i> is the name of the local file containing the job. If you specify BC instead of
TO on the SUBMIT command, the job's output will be sent to the NOS print queue where it will be printed
on one of the system's printers.
      </p>
      <p>
Control Data mainframes running the NOS 1 operating system support a subsystem named TIELINE. TIELINE is an ancestor of TLF on NOS 2. TIELINE
implements the HASP data communication protocol and enables a host running NOS 1 to act as a remote batch station. For example, it can be
used to connect a machine running NOS 1 to a machine running NOS 2 and RBF. It allows users of a NOS 1 system to submit batch jobs to a
connected NOS 2 system.
      </p>
      <p>
TIELINE also allows users of NOS 2 to submit batch jobs to NOS 1. TIELINE places files received on punch streams into the NOS 1 batch input queue.
For example, a NOS 2 user can submit a job to NOS 1 using the ROUTE command, as in:
      </p>
      <pre>
     ROUTE,lfn,DC=PU,UN=station-id
      </pre>
      <p>
where <i>lfn</i> is the name of a file containing a NOS 1 batch job, and <i>station-id</i> is the username used by TIELINE to log into RBF on the
NOS 2 system. A job file destined for NOS 1 might look like:
      </p>
      <pre>
JOB.
USER,GUEST,GUEST.
FTN.
LGO.
