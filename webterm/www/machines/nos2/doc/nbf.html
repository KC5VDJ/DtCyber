The Cyber 865 and 175 support NBF, the Network Batch Facility. NBF enables NOS users to submit batch jobs to the various
other systems supporting TCP/IP in the Nostalgic Computing Center intranet, i.e., the VAX/VMS, TOPS-20, RSX-11M-Plus,
and Unix systems. NBF also arranges for the output from those jobs to be returned to the NOS system from which the jobs are submitted.
      </p>
      <p>
To submit a batch job to any of the TCP/IP-supporting systems from either of the Cyber systems, a user specifies the target system's
3-character LID (logical identifier) on the job card (first line) of the file to be submitted. The second line of each job specifies
a LOGIN command providing login credentials for the target system. Subsequent lines of the file represent commands in the target
system's job command language.
      </p>
      <p>
An NBF job file can have multiple records. The first record provides the commands to be executed on the target system (as described
above), and additional records can provide data for the commands in the first record (e.g., program source code and/or input data for
programs executed). The first line of each such record can be a .FILE or .TEMP directive specifying the name of a file in which to
store the data specified in subsequent lines of the record. The .FILE directive indicates that the file is to be saved. The .TEMP
directive indicates that the file is temporary, and NBF arranges for these temporary files to be deleted from the target
system automatically when the job completes.
      </p>
      <p>
For example, a job file destined for VAX1 might look like:
      </p>
      <pre>
/JOB
/NOSEQ
MYJOB,ST=VX1.
LOGIN <i>username</i> <i>password</i>
$FORTRAN HELLO
$LINK HELLO
$RUN HELLO
/EOR
.TEMP HELLO.FOR
      PRINT *, ' HELLO WORLD!'
      STOP
      END</pre>
      <p>
To submit this job to VAX1 and cause the output to be returned to your wait queue, execute the SUBMIT command as in:
      </p>
      <pre>
    SUBMIT,<i>lfn</i>,TO.</pre>
      <p>
Where <i>lfn</i> is the name of the local file containing the job. If you specify BC instead of
TO on the SUBMIT command, the job's output will be sent to the NOS print queue, and you can visit
the <a href="http://www.nostalgiccomputing.org:8081" target="ncc-output-folders">Nostalgic Computing Center Output Folders</a> page
to find it.
      </p>
      <p>
Each machine to which NBF can send jobs is identified by a unique LID (Logical IDentifier). To route a job to a particular
machine, its LID is specified on the job's jobcard, as described above. The following table lists the machines at the
Nostalgic Computing Center to which NBF can send jobs:
