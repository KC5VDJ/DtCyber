<p>
The University of Massachusetts (UMass) created an e-mail system for Control Data Cyber 170 systems. It was known as
the UMass Mailer, and it was widely distributed to universities with Cyber 170 systems in North America and Europe.
It enabled these systems to exchange e-mail using a variety of data communication protocols. The UMass Mailer is installed
on the Cyber 865 and 175 at the Nostalgic Computing Center. It enables these systems to exchange e-mail with each other
as well as the TOPS-20, VAX/VMS, RSX-11M-Plus, Ultrix, and 2.11BSD Unix systems at the NCC.
</p>
<p>
Use the MAIL command to enter the UMass Mailer utility and list the headers of e-mail messages in the user's mailbox.
If the mailbox is not empty, read the first message.  Next, compose and send an e-mail message to the Guest user on the
TOPS-20 system and to the Guest user on the IBM 4381. One copy of the message will be sent via
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">SMTP</a> to the TOPS-20 system
where it will be delivered directly to the Guest user there. A second copy of the message will be sent via
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BITNET" target="_blank">NJE</a> to the Guest user on the IBM 4381.
Exit from the mail utility when done.
