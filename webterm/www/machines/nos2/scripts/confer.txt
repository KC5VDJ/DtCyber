<p>
The University of Massachusetts (UMass) created an interactive conferencing application for Control Data Cyber 170 systems.
It was known as CONFER, and it was widely distributed to universities with Cyber 170 systems in North America and Europe.
It enabled users of these systems to create online conferences (i.e., chat rooms) and send instant messages to each other
within these conferences.

<p>
Use the HELLO command to enter the multi-user CONFER application, then use CONFER's <i>/help</i> command to display the full
list of commands it recognizes.  Next, use the <i>/create</i> command to create a conference, use the <i>/show</i> command
to display all active conferences and associated users, and send a message to members of the conference created. Finally,
use the <i>bye</i> command to exit CONFER and re-enter IAF (the Cyber interactive facility).
