<p>
Use the NEW and TEXT commands to create a batch job that will execute on Prime1, a Prime P9950 supermini
running the PRIMOS 19.2 operating system.
Use the SUBMIT command to submit it for execution. The job's output will be returned to the NOS system that
originated the job, and that system will print it. After printing, it will be filed in the
<a href="http://www.nostalgiccomputing.org:8081/" target="ncc-output-folders">Nostalgic Computing Center
Output Folders</a>. Be patient, as batch is a low priority background operation on PRIMOS, so it might take
several minutes before the job completes and its output becomes available.
</p>
<p>
Note also that Prime1 is physically connected to the CDC Cyber 865, so when this example is
run from the CDC Cyber 175, the 175 will relay it automatically to the 865, and the 865 will then submit
it to Prime1. The 865 will relay the job's output back to the 175, and the 175 will then print it.
