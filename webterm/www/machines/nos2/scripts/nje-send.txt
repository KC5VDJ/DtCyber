<p>
Use the NEW and TEXT commands to create a file that will be sent to a user on the IBM 4381 mainframe
running the VM/CMS operating system.
Use the NJROUTE command to enqueue it for transmission across the NJE network. Use the DC=PU parameter
on the NJROUTE command to identify the file as a punch stream, specify the DNN parameter to identify the
destination host, and use the DRN parameter to identify the recipient on that host.
</p>
<p>
Note that the IBM 4381 is physically connected to the CDC Cyber 175 and to the IBM 3033 on the NJE network. The 4381 is
not directly connected to the CDC Cyber 865, but the 865 is directly connected to the 3033. Consequently,
when this example is run from the CDC Cyber 865, the 865 will forward the file automatically to the 3033, and the 3033 will then
deliver it to the 4381. When this example is run from the CDC Cyber 175, the 175 can deliver the file directly to
the 4381.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of whether the file orginates from the 865 or 175, it will be delivered to the virtual reader of the
recipient user on the 4381, and that user can use the CMS READCARD command to receive it.
