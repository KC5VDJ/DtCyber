      <p>
TIELINE is a NOS subsystem that enables the local Control Data mainframe to act as a remote batch station, allowing users of the
local system to submit batch jobs to other computer systems acting as remote batch hosts. TIELINE also arranges for the output from
these jobs to be returned to the local system where it will be printed on local output devices. The data communication
protocol used in exchanging jobs and output is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Automatic_Spooling_Priority" target="_blank">HASP</a>,
a protocol originally implemented for IBM mainframes.
      </p>
      <p>
To distinguish a job to be processed by TIELINE from an ordinary batch job, the job card must look like the job card of an IBM
JCL job. Specifically, it must begin with two "/" characters, as in:
<pre>
     //JOB.
</pre>
Use the ROUTE command in the usual way to route the job into the NOS output queue, as in:
<pre>
     ROUTE,lfn,DC=IN
</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
If TIELINE is built to communicate with a NOS 2 system running RBF (Remote Batch Facility), it will remove the two leading "/"
characters before transmitting the job. This enables NOS 2 to recognize the job card as a correctly formed one for NOS 2. If TIELINE
is built to communicate with an IBM operating system such as MVS with JES2 or VM/CMS with RSCS, the job card is transmitted without
editing it because a correctly formed IBM job card begins with two "/" characters. When the job completes, the system on which it
ran will return its output to TIELINE, and TIELINE will place the output in the output queue for printing.
      </p>
      <p>
For example, a job file destined for NOS 2 might look like:
      </p>
<pre>
//JOB.
USER,GUEST,GUEST.
FTN5.
LGO.
/*EOR
      PROGRAM HELLO
      PRINT *, 'HELLO WORLD'
      STOP
      END

</pre>
      <p>
TIELINE also enables users on remote mainframes to submit batch jobs to the local host. TIELINE places files received on punch streams
into the local system's job input queue. For example, a user on a remote NOS 2 system can submit a batch job to the local NOS 1 system by
entering a ROUTE command, as in:
<pre>
     ROUTE,lfn,DC=PU,UN=id

</pre>
where <i>lfn</i> is a file containing the job to be submitted, and <i>id</i> is the username used by TIELINE to connect to the NOS 2 system
(e.g., RJE1).
