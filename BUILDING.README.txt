==========================
BUILDING dtCYBER on Linux.
==========================

In older Ubuntu versions and older X11s in general, there used to be the fonts

-b&h-lucidatypewriter-* ...

To use these fonts on modern installations, you MUST also install xfonts-base, AND (xfonts-75dpi OR xfonts-100dpi)
and log off/on again to ensure that the X11 fonts server is refreshed.

====================================
BUILDING dtCYBER on Raspberry Pi OS
====================================

Suggested steps BEFORE cloning and making dtCyber listed below.

Based on starting with clean default image of 23 bit Raspberry Pi OS with desktop.

Last tested with Pi OS Bullseye, released February 21st 2023. However, none of the steps below is known to be OS version
dependent so should work with 64bit OS and later OS releases.

Lest tested with Kevin Jordan's repo at https://github.com/kej715/DtCyber

Update, upgrade and reboot
	sudo apt-get update -y
	sudo apt dist-upgrade -y
	sudo reboot

Install any display drivers or VNC server now.

Check if 32 bit or 64 bit (to use correct makefile later):
	uname -m

Install git-lfs (else you will not be able to clone the dtCyber repo)
	sudo apt-get install git-lfs

Install Node 16.x, and check version
	curl -sSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo bash -
	sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
	node -v

Install X11 development and fonts, and reboot to load fonts
	sudo apt-get install libx11-dev x11-utils xfonts-base xfonts-75dpi xfonts-100dpi xfonts-utils
	sudo reboot

Clone repo
	git clone <dtCyber repo of your choice>

Switch to dtcyber directory and build (change ‘make’ below for 64 bit)
	cd DtCyber
	make -f Makefile.linux64-armv8

Execute
	npm install
manually in three folders: automation, rje-station, stk, and webterm.

Change directory to the CDC OS version desired, and use ‘sudo node ….’ following README to install and run CDC OS.
