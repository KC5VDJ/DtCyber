==========================
BUILDING dtCYBER on Linux.
==========================

In older Ubuntu versions and older X11s in general, there used to be the fonts

-b&h-lucidatypewriter-* ...

To use these fonts on modern installations, you MUST also install xfonts-base, AND (xfonts-75dpi OR xfonts-100dpi)
and log off/on again to ensure that the X11 fonts server is refreshed.

============================
BUILDING dtCYBER on MAC/OSX.
============================

For recent versions of OSX (e.g. OSX 10.8 or later):

Before making dtCyber on OSX you need to install the XQuartz X11 server from
https://www.xquartz.org else the build will fail with missing X11 header files.

XQuartz must also be running before starting dtCyber else the startup will fail as the X11 display server
can not be found.
